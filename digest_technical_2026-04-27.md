## 1. Dual-use quantum hardware for quantum resource generation and energy storage
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-23 | **Relevance Score:** 0.397
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Vaibhav Sharma, Yiming Wang, Shouvik Sur

**Abstract:** Quantum resources such as entanglement form the backbone of quantum technologies and their efficient generation is a central objective of modern quantum platforms. Independently, quantum batteries have emerged as nanoscale devices that utilize collective quantum effects to store energy with a charging advantage over classical strategies. Here, we show that these two pursuits can co-exist: protocols for fast generation of resourceful quantum states can simultaneously charge a quantum battery with a collective advantage, and conversely, a quantum battery protocol with a charging advantage can produce resource-rich states. Using this connection, we propose an integrated hardware protocol on superconducting circuits in which each experimental run can interchangeably accomplish either quantum battery charging, or quantum sensing through generation of metrologically useful states. Our results establish that quantum resources and stored energy are distinct yet co-producable quantities, opening the door to modular quantum architectures that dynamically switch between sensing and energy-storage functions, thereby producing additional functionalities without extra hardware cost.

**Authors:** Lukáš Lachman, Carlos E. Lopetegui-González, Massimo Frigerio, Mattia Walschaers

**Abstract:** Entanglement is a key resource for many quantum applications. Understanding fundamental properties of entangled states is an important step towards their practical exploitation. We characterize entanglement in the context of Gaussian and non-Gaussian processes and identify entangled states that cannot be produced by any Gaussian evolution acting on separable states. This distinction exposes intrinsic limitations of Gaussian operations and highlights the role of non-Gaussian operations as an important resource. We apply this framework to develop a certification method that connects entanglement theory with quantum non-Gaussianity - an advanced quantum feature that is essential for several quantum applications. Our approach tailors the certification to experimentally relevant states that can be produced in current quantum optics experiments. We demonstrate this certification for recognizing the genuine non-Gaussian entanglement of various entangled Fock states and hybrid entangled states.

## 3. Structured Quantum State Reconstruction via Physically Motivated Operator Selection
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-23 | **Relevance Score:** 0.372
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Ayush Chambyal,  Brijesh, Rakesh Sharma

**Abstract:** Quantum state tomography (QST) scales exponentially in both measurement and computational cost, making full reconstruction impractical for multi-qubit systems. Existing approaches attempt to reduce this complexity, but do not explicitly restrict the operator space based on physically relevant correlations. We develop a structured QST framework in which the density matrix is reconstructed using a restricted set of observables in a Gibbs representation. The Structured Gibbs Quantum State Tomography (SG-QST) is built by progressively including local, nearest-neighbor, and global correlations. Benchmarking on three, four, and five-qubit. GHZ states shows that comparable fidelity can be achieved with significantly fewer parameters by restricting the operator space to physically relevant observables. These results demonstrate that physically motivated operator-space restriction enables efficient and interpretable quantum state reconstruction.

## 4. Unitary Realizations of Synchronizing Automata in Quantum Systems
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-22 | **Relevance Score:** 0.368
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Jȩdrzej Stempin, Jan Wójcik, Gabriela Banaszak, Andrzej Grudka, Marcin Karczewski, Paweł Kurzyński, Antoni Wójcik

**Abstract:** We introduce a quantum analogue of a classical synchronizing automaton. In classical case the state of a system evolves according to a set of rules forming an alphabet, and sequences of these rules, called words, govern its evolution. Certain special words, known as synchronizing words, drive the automaton into a predetermined state regardless of its initial configuration. Although such an apparently irreversible process seems incompatible with the unitarity of quantum mechanics, we present a resetting protocol based on quantum synchronizing words by incorporating auxiliary qubits whose states encode the rules of the automaton's alphabet. These qubits interact with the quantum automaton, whose state is encoded in a qudit, via a global unitary operation. When the qubit register is initially prepared in a state corresponding to a synchronizing word, the automaton evolves into a predetermined pure state independent of its initial state, while the qubit register is transformed into a complex, often entangled, state that encodes information about the automaton's original configuration. The resulting entanglement depends on both the rule set and the automaton's initial state, and we show how specific entangled states can be generated within this framework.

## 5. Reinforcement Learning for Robust Calibration of Multi-Qudit Quantum Gates
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-21 | **Relevance Score:** 0.367
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Amine Jaouadi, Sahel Ashhab

**Abstract:** Higher-dimensional quantum systems, such as qudits, offer architectural and algorithmic advantages over qubits, but their increased spectral crowding and limited controllability render high-fidelity quantum gates particularly challenging. We propose a hybrid optimization framework that integrates optimal control theory methods with contextual deep reinforcement learning to achieve robust controlled-phase gates on two qutrits. Optimal control is first used to design high-fidelity control pulses for a nominal system model. Reinforcement learning is then employed as a calibration stage that learns small residual corrections to these pulses in the presence of static model mismatch, thereby preserving good gate performance under realistic parameter uncertainties. By learning structured, low-dimensional residual corrections conditioned on device-specific parameter variations, reinforcement learning enhances the transfer robustness of nominally optimal but parameter-sensitive control solutions across ensembles of devices. Crucially, the reinforcement learning step in our framework does not compete with the optimal control step but provides the adaptability required for realistic hardware, systematically reducing the sensitivity to parameter fluctuations. Our results establish reinforcement learning as a practical and scalable ingredient for robust calibration of quantum gates in high-dimensional systems.

## 6. Single-shot quantum neural networks with amplitude estimation
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-21 | **Relevance Score:** 0.361
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Jaemin Seo

**Abstract:** Quantum neural networks (QNNs) suffer from a fundamental sampling bottleneck since quantum measurements are probabilistic, requiring many circuit executions to estimate outputs with sufficient accuracy. Conventional Monte-Carlo (MC) inference exhibits an $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{N})$ sampling error, rendering QNN inference and training costly on near-term quantum hardware, especially where each shot requires expensive qubit generation. This work introduces a "single-shot" QNN framework by integrating quantum amplitude estimation (AE) into the readout stage. By embedding a trained QNN as a state-preparation oracle within AE, outputs are estimated through coherent interference rather than repeated sampling. We demonstrate that AE-based QNN inference achieves an $\mathcal{O}(1/N)$ error even with a single shot. We further analyze noise robustness and training feasibility, showing that AE can be a powerful primitive for overcoming the sampling overhead of QNNs. This highlights that when the model itself is quantum, quantum algorithms can enhance the computation efficiency.

## 7. Quantum Homomorphic Encryption: Towards Practical and Private Computation on Untrusted Quantum Hardware
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-21 | **Relevance Score:** 0.359
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Jon Hernández-Bueno, Oscar Lage, Marivi Higuero, Jasone Astorga

**Abstract:** As quantum computing matures into a practical paradigm, the need for secure and private quantum computation on untrusted hardware becomes increasingly urgent. While classical fully homomorphic encryption has enabled computation over encrypted data in untrusted environments, a fully homomorphic and practically implementable quantum counterpart remains elusive. In this work, we propose a universal quantum homomorphic encryption (QHE) framework developed from the Quantum One-Time Pad (QOTP) scheme. Our approach (QOTPH) maintains information-theoretic security and supports a broad class of quantum operations on encrypted quantum states through a systematic set of homomorphic gate decompositions and key update rules. By leveraging the symmetric structure of QOTP and exploiting the transformation properties of quantum gates under Pauli encryption, we enable non-interactive homomorphic evaluation of arbitrary circuits expressible in the Clifford+T gate set, as well as controlled and parameterized operations relevant to variational quantum algorithms and delegated computation. We provide a formal specification of the proposed encryption model, detail its implementation procedure, and report the results obtained from both simulated environments and real quantum processors. Experimental validation demonstrates the correctness of the homomorphic operations and the preservation of key secrecy under circuit-level noise and real-device constraints. This work takes a step toward bridging the gap between theoretical quantum homomorphic encryption and practical realization on near-term quantum hardware, offering a scalable and symmetric cryptographic primitive for privacy-preserving quantum computation.

## 8. Double Slit Experiment in the Heisenberg Picture of Quantum Mechanics
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-24 | **Relevance Score:** 0.358
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Vlatko Vedral

**Abstract:** We present the standard double slit experiment with non-relativistic particles in the Heisenberg Picture of quantum mechanics. Our motivation is threefold. First and foremost, and contrary to some claims in the literature, we show that there is no need to talk about non-locality when explaining the interference fringes. Secondly, we emphasise the fact that even in the non-relativistic regime, and in order to preserve locality, we should define the position and momentum observables of a particle as functions of both space and time (and not just time). Thirdly, our presentation compares the projective measurements in the Heisenberg picture with the "Church of the Larger Hilbert Space", the latter of which is seldom discussed in the Heisenberg picture of quantum mechanics.

## 9. Perspective: Quantum Computing on Magnetic Racetrack
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-21 | **Relevance Score:** 0.355
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Ji Zou, Jelena Klinovaja, Daniel Loss

**Abstract:** Magnetic domain walls have long been pursued as carriers of classical information for storage and processing. With the ability to create, control, and probe domain walls at the nanoscale, they are recently recognized as an ideal platform for studying macroscopic quantum effects and provide a natural blueprint for building scalable quantum computing architectures. In particular, the experimentally demonstrated high mobility of domain walls makes them not only suitable as stationary qubits but also as flying qubits, which may offer advantages over currently explored quantum computing platforms. In this Perspective, we outline our current understanding of the essential ingredients and key requirements for realizing universal quantum computation based on magnetic domain walls. We highlight promising concrete material platforms and identify the experiments that are still needed to advance this concept. We also discuss the potential challenges and point to new opportunities in this emerging research direction at the interface between magnetism and quantum information science.

## 10. Average metric adjusted skew information of coherence under conical 2-designs generalized equiangular measurements
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-22 | **Relevance Score:** 0.351
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Baolong Cheng, Linlin Ye, Zhaoqi Wu

**Abstract:** Quantum coherence is an important quantum resource which plays a pivotal role in the field of quantum information. Based on metric adjusted skew information, we define a measure of quantum uncertainty to study average coherence under conical 2-designs generalized equiangular measurements, and prove the equivalence of this measure to the scaled average coherence based on metric adjusted skew information under a set of unitary groups, operator orthonormal bases, and mutually unbiased bases. We also derive two trade-off relations by this measure and solve a conjecture. Furthermore, we give two entanglement criteria by this measure and conical 2-designs generalized equiangular measurement, respectively, and illustrate the effectiveness of them by explicit examples.

## 11. Replay-buffer engineering for noise-robust quantum circuit optimization
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-23 | **Relevance Score:** 0.349
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Akash Kundu, Sebastian Feld

**Abstract:** Deep reinforcement learning (RL) for quantum circuit optimization faces three fundamental bottlenecks: replay buffers that ignore the reliability of temporal-difference (TD) targets, curriculum-based architecture search that triggers a full quantum-classical evaluation at every environment step, and the routine discard of noiseless trajectories when retraining under hardware noise. We address all three by treating the replay buffer as a primary algorithmic lever for quantum optimization. We introduce ReaPER$+$, an annealed replay rule that transitions from TD error-driven prioritization early in training to reliability-aware sampling as value estimates mature, achieving $4-32\times$ gains in sample efficiency over fixed PER, ReaPER, and uniform replay while consistently discovering more compact circuits across quantum compilation and QAS benchmarks; validation on LunarLander-v3 confirms the principle is domain-agnostic. Furthermore we eliminate the quantum-classical evaluation bottleneck in curriculum RL by introducing OptCRLQAS which amortizes expensive evaluations over multiple architectural edits, cutting wall-clock time per episode by up to $67.5\%$ on a 12-qubit optimization problem without degrading solution quality. Finally we introduce a lightweight replay-buffer transfer scheme that warm-starts noisy-setting learning by reusing noiseless trajectories, without network-weight transfer or $ε$-greedy pretraining. This reduces steps to chemical accuracy by up to $85-90\%$ and final energy error by up to $90\%$ over from-scratch baselines on 6-, 8-, and 12-qubit molecular tasks. Together, these results establish that experience storage, sampling, and transfer are decisive levers for scalable, noise-robust quantum circuit optimization.

## 12. Quantum Advantage for Coordinated Frequency Selection Against Distributed Jammers
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-22 | **Relevance Score:** 0.343
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Stephanie Wehner

**Abstract:** Consider two parties who want to agree on a common frequency band for communication in the presence of independent jammers. Such jammers block a different subset of bands at each site, where each party can observe only its own set of unjammed bands. Yet, they must agree on a common band without communicating. We first establish the optimal classical strategy, maximizing the probability they output a common frequency band in a single shot. We proceed to show that sharing an entangled pair of local dimension d allows the parties to coordinate strictly better, provided both the number of safe bands d and the spectrum size n are sufficiently large. We study explicit quantum strategies offering a pathway to near-term demonstrations, including an explicit strategy for d = 2 that outperforms the classical optimum for all spectrum sizes, achieving a 5.4% advantage asymptotically (in n) with just one shared Bell pair. Our approach is based on a general framework for constructing quantum strategies from classical spreading sequences via symmetric orthonormalization that may be of independent interest, and opens the door to concrete applications of quantum networks for cognitive radio and spread-spectrum communication.

## 13. Level crossings and superradiant quantum phase transition for a two-qutrit quantum Rabi model
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-22 | **Relevance Score:** 0.343

**Authors:** R. Grimaudo, A. S. M. De Castro, G. Falci, A. Messina, E. Paladino, A. Messina, N. V. Vitanov

**Abstract:** A two-qutrit extension of the quantum Rabi model is studied. Despite its increased complexity, the model results to be integrable under specific, physically relevant conditions. This feature allows for the emergence of analytically tractable subdynamics. In this framework, the ground-state phase diagram can be derived, and the analysis reveals critical phenomena linked to both level crossings and quantum phase transitions.

## 14. Entanglement of two optical emitters mediated by a terahertz channel
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-23 | **Relevance Score:** 0.341
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Yanis Le Fur, Diego Martín-Cano, Carlos Sánchez Muñoz

**Abstract:** Quantum technologies in the terahertz (THz) require a coherent interface between addressable qubits and THz quantum channels -- a capacity that so far, remains largely underdeveloped. Here, we propose and demonstrate the generation of steady-state entanglement between polar quantum emitters, mediated by THz photons. We exploit strong visible-light driving of the emitters to create Rabi-split dressed eigenstates whose energy separation can be optically tuned into the THz regime. The polar nature of the emitters activates THz transitions within these eigenstates, allowing them to couple to a THz photonic mode that induces collective dissipative dynamics. A coherent driving and control of these effective THz emitters is achieved by using a sideband optical drive with detuning close to the THz transition frequency. The resulting interplay of collective dissipation and driving activates a mechanism to generate steady-state entanglement with high values of the concurrence ($C>0.9$), attainable under experimentally feasible parameters. Crucially, both coherent manipulation and quantum state tomography are implemented entirely through optical means, avoiding direct THz control and detection. This establishes a hybrid visible-THz quantum interface in which a THz channel mediates qubit-qubit entanglement (a key operational requirement for THz quantum technologies) while remaining optically accessible.

## 15. Bipartite entanglement under frequency comb pumping in parametric Josephson circuits
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-23 | **Relevance Score:** 0.34

**Authors:** Mikael Vartiainen, Ilari Lilja, Ekaterina Mukhanova, Kirill Petrovnin, Gheorghe Sorin Paraoanu, Pertti Hakonen

**Abstract:** The creation of high-quality cluster states in superconducting microwave circuits is a relevant ingredient in continuous-variable quantum computing. Although large-scale cluster states have been established in optical systems, dissipation prevents their direct applicability to the microwave realm. Recent improvements in superconducting parametric circuits, in particular Josephson parametric amplifiers (JPA) and traveling wave parametric amplifiers (TWPA), have permitted substantial progress in producing entangled states using microwave photons. In this paper, we examine experimentally and theoretically the effects of numerous parametric pump tones on the degree of two-mode squeezing in a quantum circuit and apply it to the JPA. We find that additional pumps diminish the initial two-mode correlations achieved with a single pump by redistributing it among a larger network of modes and by introducing entanglement with additional idler frequencies. Taking into account the actual heterodyne measurement conditions, the experimental results are consistent with theoretical expectations.

## 16. Monitoring photon entanglement in coupled cavities
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-23 | **Relevance Score:** 0.333
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Moises Acero, Jeremiah Harrington, Oleg L. Berman, K. Ziegler

**Abstract:** We study the dynamics of $N$ photons in a Fock state, initially located inside one cavity, and coupled by an optical fiber to a second cavity. The entanglement of the photons is monitored by projective measurements, repeated with a fixed time step. This approach is applied to the formation of a photonic N00N state. We calculate the probability of the transition of $N$ photons from the left to the right cavity and the probability of the return of $N$ photons to the left cavity under repeated projective measurements. The entanglement is analyzed for the N00N state by its fidelity and its phase sensitivity, while for the entanglement between the states in the two cavities the entanglement entropy is calculated. In addition, we study the monitored evolution of photons in a single cavity, which are coupled to a single qubit, using the Jaynes-Cummings model. Photon entanglement is analyzed in terms of the entanglement entropy. In all these cases we find that entanglement is sensitive to the details of monitoring protocol, which can be used to control photon entanglement for specific applications.

## 17. Quantum hardware noise learning via differentiable Kraus representation on tensor networks
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-22 | **Relevance Score:** 0.329
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Ryo Sakai, Yu Yamashiro

**Abstract:** We present a method for learning quantum hardware noise from a measurement distribution of a single device experiment. Each noise channel is represented by automatically differentiable Kraus operators obtained from a Stinespring-based parameterization that is completely positive and trace preserving by construction, and circuits are simulated with a matrix product density operator forward model. Independent channels are attached to each native gate type, to each nearest-neighbor crosstalk interaction, and to state preparation and measurement, and all channels are optimized end-to-end against a distance between the simulated and observed measurement distributions. On ibm_fez, a Heron-generation superconducting processor, training on a ripple-carry adder circuit reproduces the device output distribution, and the same learned parameters, applied without retraining, also track the device distribution of an unrelated multiplier circuit, indicating that the method captures intrinsic device characteristics rather than overfitting to the training circuit. A systematic evaluation across a range of benchmark circuits confirms that this generalization is consistent. We further use the learned model to perform an offline feasibility assessment of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm with an error detection scheme, demonstrating the kind of noise-aware prediction the framework is designed to enable.

## 18. Suppressing the Erasure Error of Fusion Operation in Photonic Quantum Computing
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-23 | **Relevance Score:** 0.327
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Xiangyu Ren, Yuexun Huang, Zhemin Zhang, Yuchen Zhu, Tsung-Yi Ho, Antonio Barbalace, Zhiding Liang

**Abstract:** Photonic quantum computing provides a promising route toward quantum computation by naturally supporting the measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) model. In MBQC, programs are executed through measurements on a pre-generated graph state, whose construction largely depends on probabilistic fusion operations. However, fusion operations in PQC are vulnerable to two major error sources: fusion failure and fusion erasure. As a result, MBQC compilation must account for both error mechanisms to generate reliable and efficient photonic executions. Prior state-of-the-art MBQC compilation, represented by OneAdapt, is designed for all-photonic architectures and mainly focuses on handling fusion failures. Nevertheless, it does not explicitly model fusion erasures induced by photon loss, which can be substantially more damaging than fusion failures. To mitigate fusion erasure errors, we introduce a new MBQC compilation scheme built upon the spin qubit quantum memory. We propose tree-encoded fusion, an encoding strategy that suppresses erasure errors during graph-state generation. We further incorporate this scheme into a compiler framework with algorithms that reduce the execution overhead of quantum programs. We evaluate the proposed framework using a realistic PQC simulator on six representative quantum algorithm benchmarks across multiple program scales. The results show that tree-encoded fusion achieves better robustness than alternative fusion-encoding strategies, and that our compiler provides exponential improvement over OneAdapt. In addition, we validate the feasibility of our approach through a proof-of-concept demonstration on real PQC hardware.

## 19. Operational criterion for Wigner function negativity
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-22 | **Relevance Score:** 0.327
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Paolo Solinas, Beatrice Donelli, Stefano Gherardini

**Abstract:** We introduce an operational criterion to identify Wigner function (WF) negativity for an arbitrary quantum state within the framework of quantum non-demolition measurements. This criterion corresponds to experimentally accessible schemes that enable a direct measurement of the WF, and establishes the coherent-state basis as a privileged basis for determining when the WF exhibits negative regions. We show that the absence (presence) of coherent superpositions in the coherent-state basis provides direct information about the positivity (negativity) of the WF. In particular, the absence of such superpositions constitutes a sufficient condition for WF positivity. Although a general proof of necessity remains elusive, we demonstrate that this condition is also necessary in two relevant cases: Schrödinger-cat states and higher-order cat states on a circle. More precisely, for Schrödinger-cat states we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for the positivity of the WF in full generality, whereas for high-order cat states on a circle we derive an analogous condition in the limit of a large number of densely packed coherent states.

## 20. Quantum mechanics over real numbers fully reproduces standard quantum theory
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-21 | **Relevance Score:** 0.327
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Alan C. Maioli, Evaldo M. F. Curado, Jean-Pierre Gazeau

**Abstract:** Standard quantum mechanics employs complex Hilbert spaces, but whether complex numbers are fundamental or merely convenient has long been debated. For decades, real-valued equivalents were considered mathematically possible but cumbersome. However, a landmark 2021 result claimed that any quantum theory based on real numbers is experimentally falsifiable via network Bell experiments. Yet, it remains an open question whether this falsification applies to all real-valued theories. Here we show that this conclusion rests on an incomplete real formulation, and we present a rigorous real-valued framework that perfectly reproduces all predictions of standard quantum mechanics, i.e. standard quantum mechanics. We demonstrate that the standard real tensor product ($\otimes_{\mathbb{R}}$) used in previous no-go theorems is algebraically incompatible with the rich structure of standard quantum mechanics. We present a real framework based on \ka space and prove that it is exactly isomorphic to standard quantum mechanics via an explicit bijection $γ$. The isomorphism extends to composite systems through a symplectic composition rule $\otimes^{\ks}$ that replaces the Kronecker product. Consequently, our formulation achieves the maximal $\mathrm{CHSH}_{3}$ violation of $6\sqrt{2}$ using purely real variables, directly contradicting previous falsification claims. These results demonstrate that complex numbers are not fundamentally required by nature; rather, they encode a deeper real geometric structure that governs quantum interference and entanglement, settling this long debate.

## 21. Speed-oriented quantum circuit backend
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-23 | **Relevance Score:** 0.324
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Sören Wilkening

**Abstract:** We present a new software package for efficient quantum circuit generation, designed to achieve optimal runtime performance. Despite being in an early stage of development, our implementation demonstrates significant advantages over existing tools. Using the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) as a benchmark, we show that our backend can generate circuits for systems with up to 2000 qubits faster than widely used frameworks such as Qiskit and Q#. This improvement is particularly relevant for applications where classical preprocessing time, including circuit generation, must be minimized to not diminish any potential quantum advantage - for example, in combinatorial optimization tasks. Additionally, our software provides high-level primitives for bit- and integer-level manipulations, offering a simplified interface for integration with high-level quantum programming languages.

## 22. Native quantum games from interacting discrete-time quantum walks
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-22 | **Relevance Score:** 0.32
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Rashid Ahmad

**Abstract:** We study how strategic interaction can arise from controlled quantum dynamics rather than being imposed as an external mathematical structure. We introduce a class of interaction-defined quantum games in which players are represented by distinguishable quantum walkers, strategies correspond to local coin operations, and payoffs are defined as expectation values of physical observables. Using interacting discrete-time quantum walks as a concrete platform, we demonstrate numerically that competitive, cooperative, and asymmetric games admit stable stationary strategy profiles when the walkers are coupled, while no non-trivial equilibria exist in the absence of interaction. To clarify the game-theoretic structure, we derive an analytic perturbative decomposition of the payoff function in the weak-interaction regime, showing explicitly that strategic coupling originates from interaction-induced interference terms in the joint probability distribution. For a collision-based phase interaction, the payoff becomes non-separable at first order in the interaction strength and generically admits stationary points satisfying the Nash conditions. Our results provide a physically explicit realization of strategic interdependence in quantum transport processes and establish interacting quantum walks as a minimal platform for studying game-theoretic behavior emerging from unitary dynamics.

## 23. Spectral phase encoding for quantum kernel methods

**Authors:** Pablo Herrero Gómez, Antonio Jimeno Morenilla, David Muñoz-Hernández, Higinio Mora Mora

**Abstract:** Abstract Quantum kernel methods are promising for near-term quantum machine learning, yet their behavior under data corruption remains insufficiently understood. We analyze how quantum feature constructions degrade under controlled additive noise. We introduce Spectral Phase Encoding (SPE), a hybrid construction combining a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) front-end with a diagonal phase-only embedding. Within a unified framework, we compare the resulting DFT-based quantum-kernel pipeline () against alternative quantum variants based on principal component analysis (PCA) and random projections (RP), as well as classical support vector machine (SVM) baselines, under identical clean-data hyperparameter selection. Robustness is quantified via dataset fixed-effects regression with wild cluster bootstrap inference across heterogeneous real-world datasets. Across the matched quantum family, DFT-based preprocessing yields the smallest degradation rate as noise increases, with statistically supported slope differences relative to PCA and RP. Compared with classical baselines, shows degradation comparable to linear SVM and more favorable than radial basis function (RBF) SVM under the present tuning protocol. Hardware experiments further confirm that the resulting overlap-estimation primitive remains executable and numerically stable. Taken together, these results support a robustness-first view of quantum kernel evaluation and show that, within the controlled pipeline family studied here, structure-aligned spectral preprocessing combined with a shared diagonal quantum embedding can yield slower degradation under corruption.

**Authors:** Kilian Unterguggenberger, Alok Gokhale, Aleksei Tsarapkin, Wentao Zhang, Katja Höflich, Herbert Fotso, Tommaso Pregnolato, Laura Orphal-Kobin, Tim Schröder

**Abstract:** The optical spectrum of a quantum system is jointly determined by the properties of the emitter and the driving field. All-optical spectral control can hence be a promising method to engineer the properties of single photon emitters for quantum technological applications. It was proposed that driving a two-level system with a periodic sequence of optical pi-pulses during the excited state lifetime shifts the emission and absorption maximum to an arbitrarily detuned pulse carrier frequency, enabling the mitigation of spectral diffusion in noisy emitters. In this article, we report on the first experimental observation of this effect. We implement the protocol on a solid-state emitter and reduce its inhomogeneously broadened optical linewidth close to the lifetime limit. By detuning the excitation laser, we are able to concentrate approximately half of the absorption to a freely selectable target frequency. Our approach is solely based on properties of coherently evolving quantum systems, rendering it applicable to a wide range of individual and ensembles of quantum emitters.

**Abstract:** In classical dynamical systems, stochastic feedback can stabilize otherwise unstable periodic orbits, giving rise to distinct controlled and uncontrolled phases as the rate of control application is varied. In this work, we apply these control protocols in classical, semiclassical, and quantum regimes to the kicked top, a paradigmatic model of quantum chaos. The quantum kicked top, modeled as the dynamics of a spin-S object, naturally interpolates between these regimes with the spin size S acting as an effective Planck constant. We show that the dynamics of the kicked top in classical, semiclassical, and fully quantum limits can all be controlled using stochastic feedback protocols. Comparing the full quantum dynamics to a truncated Wigner approximation that captures quantum noise but neglects interference beyond the Ehrenfest time, we find that low-moment observables are largely accounted for semiclassically, while the remaining discrepancy in higher moments is consistent with contributions from interference and possibly nonlinearities in rare trajectories that explore the compact phase space. We also find rapid purification in the numerics studied for all rates of control considered, suggesting that control quenches the top's ability to encode a qubit of quantum information even in the uncontrolled phase.

## 26. Bound, antibound and resonance two-photon states in chiral waveguide QED

**Authors:** Alexander Poddubny

**Abstract:** We present a theoretical study of the two-particle spectrum $ω(K)$ for the chiral waveguide QED setup of an array of two-level atoms directionally interacting with photons propagating along the waveguide. We demonstrate that for each pair center-of-mass momentum $K$ there exist distinct solutions with $\Imω\le 0$ in the two-particle spectrum, corresponding to bound, antibound and resonance states, in addition to the continuum of scattering states. Contrary to previous studies, which showed the bound and resonance-state spectra only over a limited range of $K$, the calculated spectrum is consistent across all $K$ values. An interesting finding is that the real part of the spectrum $\Re ω(K)$ in the chiral model is gapless.

## 27. Reflections on Quantum Reflectometry: Quantum and Tunneling capacitances as well as Sisyphus and Hermes resistances

**Abstract:** When a quantum electronic device is coupled to an electrical resonator, admittance changes of the quantum subsystem may be detected. The effective reactance may include capacitive and inductive terms that incorporate geometric, quantum, and tunneling components; while the effective resistance may be composed of Sisyphus and Hermes terms linked to relaxation and decoherence, respectively. Such reflectometry is usually studied when all characteristic times of the quantum system are much shorter than the resonator's period, in which case only stationary quantum states are probed. We present a rigorous description of a driven-dissipative qudit-resonator system. Our approach demonstrates how to strictly introduce quantum and tunneling capacitances as well as Hermes and Sisyphus resistances, and how these values are modified when the dynamics of the subsystems becomes mutually dependent. We present the cases of a Cooper-pair box, a single-Cooper-pair transistor, a double quantum dot, and a single-electron box. Our approach can be applied to describe any quantum system coupled to any classical resonator.

**Abstract:** Determining the exponentially scaled ground state wavefunction and the associated molecular properties remains one of the central challenges in quantum chemistry. Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms implemented on quantum computers offer a promising route toward addressing this problem. However, despite several successful demonstrations on small molecular systems, accurate simulations of large and chemically realistic molecules remain difficult due to the limited capability of noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. To bypass the limitations of NISQ devices, while simultaneously retaining the accuracy of the ground state energy estimations, we propose a dynamic ansatz construction strategy based on operator commutativity and energy driven screening within density matrix embedding theory (DMET) framework. The partitioning of the full system allows us to dynamically construct the ansatz over individual embedded subsystems, allowing each embedding problem be solved individually to a desired accuracy. The embedding Hamiltonian is updated in a self-consistent manner with dynamically formulated wavefunction, and their coupled optimization leads to accurate and efficient description of the overall system. To assess the performance of this approach, we apply it to several molecular systems and chemical processes with up to 144 qubits. These simulations require at most 20 qubits at a time and demonstrate improved accuracy and significantly reduced quantum gate requirements compared with conventional ansatze. We further investigate the impact of various fragmentation strategies and demonstrate the adaptability of our approach at each step of the DMET self-consistency cycle that leads to significantly improved accuracy for strongly correlated system.

## 29. Continuous-variable photonic quantum extreme learning machines for fast collider-data selection
**Source:** EPJ Quantum Technology | **Date:** 2026-04-27 | **Relevance Score:** 0.31

**Authors:** Benedikt Maier, Michael Spannowsky, Simon Williams

**Abstract:** Abstract We study continuous-variable photonic quantum extreme learning machines as fast, low-overhead front-ends for collider data processing. Data is encoded in photonic modes through quadrature displacements and propagated through a fixed-time Gaussian quantum substrate. The final readout occurs through Gaussian-compatible measurements to produce a high-dimensional random feature map. Only a linear classifier is trained, using a single logistic regression, so retraining is fast, and the optical path and detector response set the analytical and inference latency. We evaluate this architecture on two representative classification tasks, top-jet tagging and Higgs-boson identification, with parameter-matched multi-layer perceptron (MLP) baselines. Using standard public datasets and identical train, validation, and test splits, the photonic Quantum Extreme Learning Machine (QELM) outperforms an MLP with two hidden units for all considered training sizes, and matches or exceeds an MLP with ten hidden units at large sample sizes, while training only the linear readout. These results indicate that Gaussian photonic extreme-learning machines can provide compact and expressive random features at fixed latency. The combination of deterministic timing, rapid retraining, low optical power, and room temperature operation makes photonic QELMs a credible building block for online data selection and even first-stage trigger integration at future collider experiments.

**Authors:** Kenta Koshihara, Kazuya Yuasa

**Abstract:** We study the thermodynamics of a quantum measurement-powered engine that converts energy injected by measurement backaction into work. We consider an engine with a finite-dimensional working substance, driven purely by quantum measurements, i.e., by bare quantum measurements, without feedback control or thermal contact in the thermodynamic cycle. On the basis of a Poincaré-like recurrence theorem for general quantum channels, we prove a no-go result for work extraction from such an engine in the steady regime. In the steady regime, quantum measurements become nondisturbing and do not inject energy into the working substance. Consequently, no work can be extracted. This result reveals the necessity of an entropy-decreasing process, such as feedback control or thermal contact, for work extraction in steady-cycle measurement-powered engines.

**Authors:** David Kremer, Nicolas Dupuis

**Abstract:** Peaked quantum circuits, whose output distribution is sharply concentrated on a single bitstring, have emerged as a promising candidate for verifiable quantum advantage, as the correctness of the quantum output can be checked by simply comparing against the known peak. Recent work by Gharibyan et al. arXiv:2510.25838 claimed heuristic quantum advantage using peaked circuits executed on Quantinuum's 56-qubit H2 processor. These peaked circuits concentrate their output on a single hidden bitstring by training a shallow simulable circuit variationally and inserting an obfuscated permutation to increase the depth to a level that makes classical simulation intractable, with estimated runtimes of years for the largest instances. We show that these circuits can be efficiently simulated classically. We describe a method that efficiently performs a full tensor network contraction, allowing near-exact sampling and extraction of the peaked bitstring. The method exploits the mirrored structure of the circuit and iteratively cancels both halves into a Matrix Product Operator (MPO), and avoids the obfuscated permutation by greedily reducing the MPO bond dimension through a process we call unswapping. The method can fully contract and extract the peak of the largest circuit in approximately one hour on a single GPU, around half the time it took to run on the quantum hardware.

**Abstract:** We describe the design, implementation, and nine-month operational experience of the software management stack for Lagrange, an IQM Spark five-qubit superconducting quantum computer jointly acquired by LINKS Foundation, Politecnico di Torino and the Italian National Institute of Metrological Research (INRiM), and managed by LINKS. Lagrange is, to our knowledge, the first quantum computer in Italy that is fully operational and accessible to students and researchers from multiple institutions under formal service agreements, and to the general public under commercial agreements. When installed in mid-2025, the IQM Spark hardware was delivered by the vendor with authentication only: no billing, project management or fair usage enforcement were provided. We developed a modular middleware layer that filled that gap without modifying any vendor client software, by intercepting API calls through a proxy that enforces project-based budgets, reservation-aware authorisation, and per-user fairness policies. The middleware adopts a plugin architecture that cleanly separates vendor-specific logic from site-specific policies, enabling reuse across different quantum hardware backends and deployment contexts. Since entering production in September 2025, the system has processed over 240,000 quantum jobs totalling more than 1 week of QPU execution time, with greater than 98% uptime. Notably, students at Politecnico di Torino regularly use the machine during both lectures and formal examinations -- a practice we believe to be unique in Europe. We report on the system architecture, the operational lessons learned, and the infrastructure choices that made this deployment possible.

## 33. Arrow of Time as an indicator of Measurement-Induced Phase Transitions

**Authors:** Nitay Hurvitz, Alon Kochol, Victor Fleurov, Eran Sela

**Abstract:** Measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPTs) in monitored quantum systems are typically diagnosed using entanglement-based measures. Here, we develop a complementary thermodynamic perspective based on the arrow of time (AoT), which arises from the intrinsic irreversibility of the quantum measurements driving these transitions. We study the AoT - defined as the logarithmic ratio of forward and backward trajectory probabilities - across a family of models exhibiting MIPTs. We find that, like entanglement entropy, the AoT is a nonlinear functional of the averaged density matrix; however, in contrast to entanglement, it is associated with a local operator. To determine whether the AoT exhibits critical behavior, we formulate and exactly solve a model of a random quantum circuit with non-projective measurements. This allows us to analytically demonstrate that the AoT displays nonanalytic behavior and identify its critical exponent. Our results establish the AoT as a novel diagnostic for phase transitions in monitored quantum systems.

**Abstract:** Active matter is driven out of equilibrium by a local influx of energy. While classical active matter has been extensively studied, the extension of active matter concepts to quantum systems has been explored far less. In this work we develop a full quantum description based on the Wigner function. By introducing a hybrid Wigner master equation that incorporates classical active motion and quantum degrees of freedom, we compute the quantum mean-squared displacement (MSD) using established techniques from classical active matter. We analytically derive the time dependence of the MSD and clarify the conditions under which the characteristic scaling with time $\mathrm{MSD}\sim t^{6}$ emerges. We further show that, for certain parameter and initial conditions, the MSD can exhibit an even steeper scaling regime $\mathrm{MSD}\sim t^{7}$, and we examine the robustness of these behaviors against quantum fluctuations of the initial state.

**Authors:** Shuangshuang Fu, Shunlong Luo, Yue Zhang

**Abstract:** We initiate an investigation into a notion of state complexity for discrete-variable quantum systems. Specifically, we propose an information-theoretic quantifier for the complexity of quantum states within the stabilizer formalism of quantum computation. This is achieved by leveraging the symmetric Jordan product (associated with classicality) and the skew-symmetric Lie product (linked to quantumness) between the square root of the quantum state and the Heisenberg-Weyl displacement operators. We establish the fundamental properties of this quantifier and demonstrate that state complexity is closely related to the nonstabilizerness of quantum states via the $L^4$-norm of their characteristic functions.

**Authors:** Connor Howe, Cristina Radian, Justin Woodring, Vardaan Sahgal, Brian J. McDermott

**Abstract:** Near-term hardware is constrained by high error rates, small qubit counts, and relatively low output fidelity, making the execution of large, high performance quantum circuits difficult. Circuit partitioning (or circuit cutting) has emerged as a promising approach to circumvent these limitations by decomposing circuits into smaller subcircuits at two-qubit interaction points. However, it remains unclear which classes of circuits benefit the most from partitioning and under what hardware conditions it is most effective. In this work, we evaluate the suitability of quantum circuits for partitioning from three perspectives: improving fidelity, enabling distributed execution, and scaling to larger circuit sizes. Specifically, we compare uncut circuit execution against two circuit partitioning approaches: Qiskit's automatic cut finding technique and a custom performance optimized circuit cutting method. We also measure these across GHZ, QFT, brickwork, and random quantum circuits ranging from 4 to 14 qubits, using mean absolute error of expectation values and overall output fidelity. Our results show that partitioning benefits larger, highly interconnected circuits, with our custom method reducing error by up to 55\% and improve fidelity for GHZ circuits, but degrading performance for brickwork circuits at larger scales.

## 37. Entanglement and information scrambling in long-range measurement-only circuits

**Authors:** Abigail McClain Gomez, Fiona Abney-McPeek, Hong-Ye Hu, Susanne F. Yelin, Ceren B. Dağ

**Abstract:** Measurement-only circuits provide a minimal setting in which repeated local projections can either generate or suppress many-body entanglement, giving rise to measurement-induced phase transitions and dynamical regimes, that might have no unitary counterpart. Here we investigate entanglement and information transitions in one-dimensional measurement-only Clifford circuits with long-range two-qubit parity checks. By tuning both the measurement range and density per layer, we uncover a broad set of phases whose classification requires probes beyond entanglement entropy, such as mutual information, tripartite mutual information, purification from an ancilla, and Bell-cluster statistics. We map phase diagrams using large-scale Clifford simulations for two protocols: a random-basis design in which each measurement is randomly chosen from $\lbrace XX,YY,ZZ \rbrace$, and a single-basis design in which the basis is fixed within each layer but varies between layers, hence introducing more structure to the circuit. We map the trajectory-averaged entanglement entropy to a two-dimensional statistical mechanics model by extending a replica-based method to random-basis measurement-only circuits, and show that a continuous-time limit yields an effective long-range XX hamiltonian in the steady state. This connection links the observed volume-law to sub-volume-law entanglement transition to the boundary between a continuous symmetry broken phase and a critical XY phase. Strikingly, in structured (single-basis) circuits we find a phase in which volume-law and long-range entanglement coexists with rapid, size-independent purification of an ancilla qubit, and the absence of scrambling, highlighting measurement-only circuits as a promising route to efficiently preparing highly entangled and technologically useful quantum states.

## 38. Quantum metrology via mitigation of single-photon loss using an engineered nonlinear oscillator
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-22 | **Relevance Score:** 0.3
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Tian-Le Yang, Wen Ning, Zhen-Biao Yang, Shi-Biao Zheng

**Abstract:** The fragility of quantum metrological advantages under loss remains a major barrier to practical quantum sensing. For a two-photon-driven (TPD) Kerr resonator (TPD-Kerr model) subject to unavoidable single-photon loss (SPL), both the quantum Fisher information gain and squeezing level exhibit hard-to-track long-lived damped oscillations, restricting useful sensing and squeezing to extremely short time windows. We show that adding engineered two-photon loss (ETPL) -- forming a TPD-Kerr-ETPL hybrid model -- significantly mitigates these oscillations and converts the decay into a smooth, monotonic drop. This extends the high-sensitivity windows by over an order of magnitude. Moreover, we reveal a temporal hierarchy of quantum resources: the initial boost in metrological sensitivity arises from Gaussian squeezing, while sustained high-precision sensing stems from dissipatively stabilized non-Gaussian even-parity cat states. Crucially, only in models that include ETPL -- such as the TPD-Kerr-ETPL and TPD-ETPL systems -- does the dynamics actively mitigate SPL's detrimental effects, transforming damped oscillation into a smooth, easily trackable trajectory and enabling a prolonged, usable metrological window. Our approach transcends encoding-based or feedback-controlled schemes, offering a fully autonomous route to high-precision measurement without real-time feedback control. This establishes a general design principle: engineered loss, combined with appropriate driving, can actively preserve metrologically useful non-Gaussian quantum resources even in the presence of SPL -- paving the way toward robust, scalable quantum sensors in superconducting circuits, optomechanics, and trapped-ion platforms.

**Authors:** Masatake Yamada, Kurama Hirano, Masahiro Yabuno, Shigehito Miki, Tsuyoshi Kodama, Hideki Shimoi, Takashi Yamamoto, Rikizo Ikuta

**Abstract:** Interconnecting heterogeneous quantum systems is an important step toward realizing the quantum internet. We propose a quantum network hub that interfaces local quantum devices with dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) networks in the telecom band via quantum frequency conversion (QFC) with frequency-channel selectivity. We show that standard periodically poled lithium niobate waveguides used for QFC exhibit a dispersion sweet spot, for example around the 780 nm band, enabling wide tunability of the pump wavelength while maintaining phase matching. Experimentally, we demonstrate the network hub by implementing a channel-selective and polarization-insensitive QFC from 780 nm to telecom wavelengths around 1540 nm. We achieve a pump tuning range of 2 THz and successfully distribute polarization-encoded single photons into 16 frequency channels on the ITU-T DWDM grid with 25 GHz channel spacing, while preserving the quantum information. These results position the QFC-based hub as a versatile backbone for connecting a wide range of quantum devices, spanning both photonic and matter-based systems, across frequency-multiplexed telecom networks.

**Abstract:** A recent paper published on Nature [Nature,646,813(2025)] by Aziz and Howl, claims that quantum particles become entangled when they interact gravitationally, even if the gravitational potential is treated classically. We show that the entanglement found by the authors stems from discarding some of the transition amplitudes, which, when kept, guarantee that an initially factorized state remains so over time. Therefore, no entanglement is generated by the classical gravitational interaction in the scenario considered by the authors.

**Abstract:** We study random entanglement percolation in heterogeneous quantum networks, where the singlet-conversion probabilities (SCPs) of the edges are drawn from a probability distribution rather than being fixed. After briefly recalling random classical and random quantum entanglement percolation, we focus on polarization-dependent loss (PDL) as a physical source of random edge entanglement in photonic networks. In this setting, polarization imbalance induces a simple map from the PDL magnitude to the edge SCP. We illustrate this map for representative PDL models and discuss the resulting implications for entanglement percolation.

**Abstract:** Device-independence is the gold standard of quantum cryptography. To meet this standard, a central assumption is that no information leakage occurs during protocol execution. We relax this assumption by analyzing CHSH-based randomness certification and key distribution with partial leakage of the inputs, modeled in terms of a noisy channel. Our results quantify the certifiable local randomness and the secret key rate as a function of the magnitude of the input leakage.

## 43. Universality cost of non-Gaussian enhancement in continuous-variable quantum teleportation: A fidelity--deviation trade-off
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-22 | **Relevance Score:** 0.292
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Kyoungho Cho, Bongjune Kim, Jeongho Bang

**Abstract:** Continuous-variable (CV) quantum teleportation is usually benchmarked by average fidelity, but when the teleportation is repeatedly used within optical networks or measurement-based architectures, uniformity across the input ensemble becomes equally important. We analyze this issue using two complementary figures of merit: the average fidelity and the fidelity deviation, which quantifies the input dependence of the single-shot teleportation fidelity. We prove that any deterministic unity-gain teleportation channel that is displacement covariant has vanishing fidelity deviation for coherent-state benchmarking, irrespective of whether the shared entangled resource is Gaussian or non-Gaussian. Nonzero deviation therefore diagnoses covariance breaking rather than non-Gaussianity. We then show that when a protocol raises the average fidelity through input-selective conditioning, the deviation generically increases in tandem, giving a quantitative universality cost. As a concrete example, we study teleportation enhanced by the so-called measurement-based noiseless linear amplification, where a heralded filter acts on the Bell-measurement record. The resulting trade-off among average fidelity, fidelity deviation, and success probability shows that stronger filtering can improve the conditional fidelity only by concentrating the successful events in favored regions of phase space, thereby suppressing the success probability and reducing input uniformity. Our results provide an operational framework for distinguishing genuine channel improvement from selectivity-driven post-selected advantage and suggest that the probabilistic CV teleportation should be assessed with average quality, universality, and heralding rate treated on an equal footing.

**Authors:** Nikita Guseynov, Zoë Holmes, Armando Angrisani

**Abstract:** We introduce coherent-state propagation, a computational framework for simulating bosonic systems. We focus on bosonic circuits composed of displaced linear optics augmented by Kerr nonlinearities, a universal model of bosonic quantum computation that is also physically motivated by driven Bose-Hubbard dynamics. The method works in the Schrödinger picture representing the evolving state as a sparse superposition of coherent states. We develop approximation strategies that keep the simulation cost tractable in physically relevant regimes, notably when the number of Kerr gates is small or the Kerr nonlinearities are weak, and prove rigorous guarantees for both observable estimation and sampling. In particular, bosonic circuits with logarithmically many Kerr gates admit quasi-polynomial-time classical simulation at exponentially small error in trace distance. We further identify a weak-nonlinearity regime in which the runtime is polynomial for arbitrarily small constant precision. We complement these results with numerical benchmarks on the Bose-Hubbard model with all-to-all connectivity. The method reproduces Fock-basis and matrix-product-state reference data, suggesting that it offers a useful route to the classical simulation of bosonic systems.

**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-21 | **Relevance Score:** 0.288
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Netzer Moriya

**Abstract:** We propose a cavity-based scheme that uses photonic chirality to control braiding and read out non-Abelian anyons in a fractional quantum Hall platform. Counter-propagating cavity modes interfere with a classical reference tone to create a rotating pinning landscape whose direction is set by photon circulation, so that opposite photonic branches drive opposite anyon loops. This realizes a branch-conditioned braid operation and maps the resulting braid response onto cavity intermode coherence. We derive the rotating pinning term and the readout relation at the effective-theory level, identify an operating window set by subgap driving, adiabatic transport, localization, and cavity coherence, and provide phenomenological diagnostics of transport locking. In the minimal four-anyon Ising realization, the leading signal reduces to a calibrated phase; more generally, the same readout structure becomes state dependent when the relative braid operator is non-scalar. The scheme provides a cavity route to braid-sensitive readout of non-Abelian anyons without relying on fragile electronic interference fringes.

**Abstract:** We study a class of quantum dynamical maps for d-level systems that interpolate between positive, Schwarz, and completely positive evolutions. Our approach is based on a geometric analysis of the parameter space, which reveals the structure of regions corresponding to different positivity classes and their boundaries. We show that dynamical trajectories naturally move across these regions, providing a clear geometric interpretation of transitions between Markovian and non-Markovian regimes. It is shown that within presented class the evolution becomes eventually entanglement breaking. This analysis highlights the role of divisibility and eternally non-Markovian evolution.

**Abstract:** High-quality photonic Bell state measurements (BSMs) enable scalable universal quantum computing and long distance quantum communication. However, when implemented with linear optics, BSMs are fundamentally probabilistic, introducing substantial hardware overheads and limiting noise tolerance in photonic quantum computing architectures. Nonlinear interactions at the single-photon level can overcome these limitations by enabling near-deterministic photon-photon gates. Here, we demonstrate a passive photon-sorting circuit based on the induced nonlinearity arising from photon scattering in a solid-state quantum emitter. The scattering is implemented in a directional waveguide-emitter coupling interface and embedded on-chip into a linear optical circuit, through which we demonstrate sorting of one- and two-photon components with a success probability of 62%. We find that the current system can enable BSMs with a 57% post-selected success probability without ancillary photons, exceeding the linear-optical limit of 50%, and can be readily improved to >65% with design optimisations.

**Abstract:** Fault-tolerant quantum computing increasingly demands rigorous, circuit-level evaluation of diverse quantum error correction (QEC) protocols and efficient prototyping of new ones. Such evaluation requires both the physical circuit and its Detector Error Model (DEM) to simulate end-to-end logical error rates. However, DEM construction today is performed by manual annotation, a tedious and error-prone process that effectively limits evaluation to simple memory experiments. We present LightStim, a framework that automates DEM construction concurrently with circuit compilation by maintaining a Pauli tableau augmented with measurement records, with no protocol-specific input required. We benchmark LightStim across protocols from memory experiments to end-to-end distillation circuits; cross-validation against public implementations confirms exact detector and observable counts and consistent logical error rates. LightStim additionally accelerates the exploration of new protocols, which we demonstrate through a novel heterogeneous cross-code lattice surgery design between surface and punctured quantum Reed-Muller codes. These capabilities together make LightStim a unified infrastructure for systematic QEC protocol evaluation and exploration.

**Abstract:** We explore the application of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to investigate the ground state properties, particularly the entanglement entropy, of the Transverse Field Ising Model (TFIM) in one, two, and three dimensions, considering systems of up to 27 spins. By benchmarking VQE results against exact diagonalization and analyzing the entanglement properties across different system sizes and geometries, we assess the algorithm's effectiveness in capturing critical phenomena. Using results of TFIM, we also investigate how VQE's expressivity and optimization influence the simulation of highly entangled quantum states. We employ different ansätze: the hardware-efficient EfficientSU2 from Qiskit, the physics-inspired Hamiltonian Variational ansätz (HVA) and HVA with symmetry breaking, and benchmark their performance using energy variance, entanglement entropy, spin correlations, and magnetization. We further discuss the implications for scaling these methods to larger quantum systems.

## 50. Near-Term Reduction in Nonlocal Gate Count from Distributed Logical Qubits
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-23 | **Relevance Score:** 0.283

**Authors:** Bruno Avritzer, Nathan Sankary

**Abstract:** Modular quantum computing architectures require error correction schemes that remain effective in the presence of noisy inter-processor operations. As such, minimizing the number of such operations on logical circuits partitioned across quantum processors is a primary objective of distributed quantum computing. In this work, we develop basic techniques for qubit allocation using an exemplar color code family and explore generalizations to other color codes. In particular, we show that a 10% reduction in processor-nonlocal gates is achievable in a setting where syndrome extraction occurs after every logical gate, as in today's devices, and that this scales to significantly greater advantages in the multi-qubit case. We also explore methods of achieving universal gate sets efficiently in this distributed logical setting and evaluate the trade-offs of multiple approaches such as magic state distillation, code switching, and a new method based on logical swaps. Finally, we discuss some considerations for an allocation algorithm for these architectures to perform scalably and connect it to existing work on quantum circuit partitions.

## 51. Symplectic split-operator method for the time-dependent unitary Tavis-Cummings model

**Authors:** Roman Ovsiannikov, Kurt Jacobs, Andrii G. Sotnikov, Denys I. Bondar

**Abstract:** We present a fast, memory-efficient, unitarity-preserving numerical method beyond the rotating-wave approximation for the closed Tavis-Cummings model in which a multilevel spin system interacts with a cavity mode. This model can describe the interaction of an ensemble of spins with a cavity mode in which the spin frequency and other parameters are time-dependent. The method exploits the fact that, while the Tavis-Cummings model is not tri-diagonal, it can be brought into tri-diagonal form by a change of basis that can be implemented purely by re-indexing (permuting basis elements), which is a fast operation. By truncating the Fock basis of the cavity mode, the computational complexity of the method is linear in the total dimension of the coupled system, both in time and memory. The method can be employed to simulate any closed quantum system whose Hamiltonian terms can be brought into tri-diagonal form.

## 52. Programming long-range interactions in analog quantum simulators
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-24 | **Relevance Score:** 0.28
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Cristian Tabares, Alberto Muñoz de las Heras, Jan T. Schneider, Alejandro González-Tudela

**Abstract:** Long-range interactions are the source of many equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body phenomena. Analog simulators based on ionic, atomic, superconducting, and molecular systems provide a natural platform to obtain these interactions using vibration- and photon-mediated processes. Recent experimental advances, such as their integration in multi-mode cavities and waveguides, or the use of Raman-assisted transitions, enable dynamical control over both the strength and the spatial range of these interactions, thereby rendering them programmable. Here, we develop a hybrid classical-quantum toolbox that exploits this tunability to enhance many-body state preparation in analog simulators beyond fixed-connectivity architectures. Our approach is based on classical pre-compilation in homogeneous small systems, whose optimized parameters are extrapolated iteratively to larger system sizes, and then refined on the quantum hardware using noise-aware hybrid re-optimization and error-mitigation techniques. We benchmark this strategy across several fermionic, spin-1/2, and spin-1 models, demonstrating orders-of-magnitude improvements in fidelity and energy estimation for system sizes ranging from 100 to 1000 particles. Finally, we show that the combination of such high-fidelity programmable state preparation techniques with tunable-range out-of-equilibrium dynamics enables controlled studies of many-body thermalization in regimes accessible to current experimental platforms. Our results establish programmable long-range interactions as a powerful resource for next-generation analog quantum simulators.

## 53. A Universal Quantum Information Preserving Photonic Switch for Scalable Quantum Networks

**Authors:** Jiapeng Zhao, Stéphane Vinet, Amir Minoofar, Michael Kilzer, Lucas Wang, Galan Moody, Vijoy Pandey, Ramana Kompella, Reza Nejabati

**Abstract:** Quantum networks are a keystone of the quantum internet. However, existing implementations remain largely confined to static point-to-point links due to the absence of a switching paradigm capable of dynamically routing fragile quantum entanglement without introducing decoherence. Here, we propose the Universal Quantum Switch, a foundational building block allowing on-demand, non-blocking, and encoding-agnostic routing of quantum information, as well as seamless modality conversion between disparate quantum platforms. We develop a prototype in thin-film lithium niobate and experimentally demonstrate robust switching with $\le 4\%$ decoherence via thermo-optic modulation and high-speed electro-optic switching of arbitrary entangled states at 1 MHz. Moreover, we show that our platform can support reconfiguration speeds up to 1 GHz. To our knowledge, this work represents the first demonstration of multi-node dynamic entanglement distribution at these speeds. Complementing these experimental results, we project the architecture's scalability, showing dimension-independent decoherence, and provide a scalable, interoperable building block for heterogeneous quantum network fabrics.

## 54. Quantum-Enhanced Recurrent Neural Networks via Variational Quantum Gating for Battery State of Health Prediction
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-22 | **Relevance Score:** 0.28
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Yin Xu, Qinglin Liu, Li Gao, Hua Xu

**Abstract:** Accurate state-of-health (SOH) estimation for lithium-ion batteries remains a challenging problem due to complex electrochemical degradation mechanisms and long-range temporal dependencies. In this work, we propose a quantum-enhanced recurrent framework, termed QLSTM, in which variational quantum circuits are directly embedded into the gating mechanisms of long short-term memory networks. By replacing classical affine transformations with parameterized unitary operations, the proposed model introduces structured nonlinear transformations into the recurrent state-transition process. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark battery datasets demonstrate that QLSTM consistently outperforms classical sequence models in both predictive accuracy and robustness, achieving significant reductions in mean absolute error (MAE), with improvements on the order of 20% compared with classical LSTM baselines. Ablation studies further confirm that these improvements arise primarily from quantum-enhanced gating rather than input-level transformations. Additional analyses on qubit scaling and noise robustness reveal that model performance is governed by a balance between expressive capacity and trainability. These results provide empirical evidence that embedding quantum computational primitives within recurrent architectures offers a structurally grounded approach to improving sequence modeling capability. The proposed framework establishes a new design paradigm for integrating quantum operators into temporal learning models, with potential applications in complex dynamical system prediction tasks.

## 55. Quantum-to-Classical Computability Transition via Negative Markov Chains
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-21 | **Relevance Score:** 0.278
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Hugo Lóio, Jacopo De Nardis, Tony Jin

**Abstract:** We develop a recently introduced representation of quantum dynamics based on sampling negative Markov chain processes. By introducing particles and antiparticles, this formalism maps generic quantum dynamics onto a Markov process defined over an exponentially large configuration space. Within this framework, quantum complexity arises from the proliferation of stochastic particles, which ultimately renders classical simulation and sampling intractable beyond a certain timescale. In the presence of noise, we demonstrate that for any unitary evolution generated by a linear combination of local or pairwise interactions, there exists at least one noise channel that effectively classicalizes the system by suppressing particle growth and making Monte Carlo sampling efficient. As a corollary, we show that for this class of unitaries, the dynamics of an open quantum spin chain subject to depolarizing noise undergoes an exact transition to classical simulability once the noise strength exceeds a critical threshold which can be efficiently determined for any model.

## 56. Co-Designing Error Mitigation and Error Detection for Logical Qubits
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-21 | **Relevance Score:** 0.278
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Rohan S. Kumar, Takahiro Tsunoda, Sophia H. Xue, Dantong Li, Robert J. Schoelkopf, Yongshan Ding

**Abstract:** Near-term quantum workloads demand error management, yet the two lightest-weight techniques, Quantum Error Detection (QED) and Probabilistic Error Cancellation (PEC), have complementary cost profiles whose joint architectural design space remains unexplored. QED encodes logical qubits and discards error-flagged runs, filtering noise with low qubit overhead but leaving residual errors; PEC can correct these in software, but at exponential cost in noise strength. If QED efficiently reduces per-gate noise, PEC's cost savings can outweigh QED's discard overhead; realizing this, however, requires solving two system-level design challenges. First, the \textit{QED interval} -- how often detection cycles are inserted -- is a tunable architectural parameter governing the cost-accuracy tradeoff. We derive an efficiency condition and show that the canonical one-cycle-per-gate frequency does not achieve break-even in any code we evaluate, while optimized intervals on high-rate Iceberg codes do. Second, we discover that naive PEC+QED integration \textit{degrades} accuracy below the QED-only baseline. The root cause is a transient error profile in the first detection cycle that corrupts PEC's noise model. We develop \textit{steady-state extraction}, a co-designed characterization protocol that isolates steady-state error behavior, reducing estimation bias by up to $10.2\times$. On a $[[6,4,2]]$ Iceberg code running QAOA ($p{=}4$--$8$) with a fixed shot budget, PEC+QED achieves $2$--$11\times$ lower absolute error and up to $31\times$ lower MSE versus PEC on physical qubits, with per-interval savings compounding over interval depth.

**Abstract:** Quantum resources are increasingly integrated into high-performance computing (HPC) and cloud environments, but quantum high-performance computing (QHPC) software stacks remain isolated, often proprietary, full-stack solutions lacking common interfaces across runtime, resource management, orchestration, and execution layers. This paper analyzes nine production QHPC stacks and identifies common design patterns and emerging requirements, covering deployment models, application interaction patterns, SDK support, and readiness for fault-tolerant operation. The survey exposes consistent needs in runtime abstraction, resource management, interconnect semantics, and observability. Based on these findings, we propose the open quantum-HPC software ecosystem ( openQSE) reference architecture as a first step toward unifying the state-of-the-practice. openQSE defines a set of layer boundaries that allow different implementations to interoperate while preserving deployment flexibility, and is structured to support both current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) workloads and future fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) systems without changes to upper-layer application interfaces.

## 58. Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing with Trapped Ions: The Walking Cat Architecture

**Abstract:** We propose a fault-tolerant quantum computer architecture for trapped-ion devices, which we call the walking cat architecture. Our blueprint includes a compiler, a detailed description of all the quantum error-correction protocols, a micro-architecture, a sufficiently fast decoder, and thorough simulations. The backbone of the architecture is a cat factory, producing cat states distributed throughout the machine, which are consumed to perform logical operations. The walking cat architecture is based entirely on a modern quantum error-correction approach called low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. We identify promising instances of the walking cat architecture, such as (1) a simple architecture based on a single LDPC code, (2) a fast architecture based on fast logical gates relying on a [[70, 6, 9]] code, equipped with Clifford-frame tracking for any 6-qubit Clifford gate, and (3) a dense architecture based on a [[102, 22, 9]]] code encoding 22 logical qubits per memory block. Our dense architecture provides a design with 110 logical qubits executing about one million T gates per day using only 2,514 physical qubits. We estimate that the quantum Hamiltonian simulation of a Heisenberg model on 100 sites can be executed within one month with 10,000 physical qubits, including all shots required to achieve chemical accuracy, suggesting that such a device could enter the regime of classically intractable physics simulations. Our design relies on hardware components that have been experimentally demonstrated on small devices. We emphasize simplicity over hypothetical performance to facilitate the practical realization of this machine. Based on this approach, we believe that a fault-tolerant quantum computer with hundreds of logical qubits capable of running millions of logical gates can be built in the near term, providing a platform to explore a broad range of applications.

**Abstract:** Precise and autonomous clocks are of fundamental interest and central importance to both foundational studies and practical applications. Here, we construct a blueprint for a quantum clock governed by time-independent interactions. By carefully-engineered coherent transport in dissipative spin chains, we achieve a scaling exponent at the precision-resolution trade-off fundamental bound, bringing this within reach of physically realistic and experimentally accessible systems. We further introduce a sudden-quench protocol that enables repeated operation through a simple initialization and detachment mechanism. Remarkably, the protocol is robust to imprecise detachment timing, implying that high-precision timekeeping can be achieved even when driven by a clock with much lower precision.

**Authors:** Noah Kaufmann, Kasper Hede Nielsen, Anders Søndberg Sørensen

**Abstract:** Entanglement has been proposed as a means to improve the sensitivity of sensing weak signals. While the degree of this quantum advantage is well understood in noiseless settings, the situation is more complex under realistic conditions, where the system is subject to decoherence. In this case, the enhancement depends on the specific noise characteristics. Previous treatments of colored noise typically assume that the noise is uncorrelated between successive experiments. Here, we consider the scenario in which the noise exhibits correlations across multiple shots. We derive a simple fundamental limit to the sensitivity based on the fact that the sensitivity cannot be better than the signal-to-noise ratio seen by the probe. Focusing on Ramsey spectroscopy with probes affected by pure classical dephasing, we show that, for suitable spatial and temporal noise correlations, entangled probes achieve a better scaling of the sensitivity with the number of probes than separable states. This demonstrates that entanglement can provide a substantial improvement for Ramsey spectroscopy subject to correlated noise.

**Authors:** Hong-Bo Huang, Hui Dong

**Abstract:** Fast qubit reset is essential for qubit reuse in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum computing era, yet it conflicts with the weak decoherence required for high-fidelity computation. We solve the time-optimal reset problem for a frequency-tunable qubit coupled to a structural environment under realistic spectral and control constraints. The optimal strategy consists of a switch--restore--switch sequence, where the qubit is moved from a low-decoherence computational configuration to a high-decoherence restoring configuration and then returned for reuse. For superconducting qubits in four representative environments, this strategy reduces the reset time from typically $\gtrsim\SI{100}{\nano\second}$ to $\SI{20}{\nano\second}$, about $40\%$ of a typical two-qubit gate time, while achieving a reset precision of $10^{-5}$. Our results identify environmental spectral structure as a practical resource for rapid, high-fidelity qubit reset and provide a design principle for qubit reuse on qubit-limited processors.

**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-22 | **Relevance Score:** 0.273
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Ryo Watanabe, Dries Sels, Joseph Tindall

**Abstract:** We adopt a two-dimensional tensor-network (TN) ansatz to simulate variational quantum algorithms on two-dimensional qubit architectures, demonstrating its capability to accurately simulate deep circuits through the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) applied to Ising spin-glass problems on heavy-hexagonal and square lattices. For heavy-hexagonal problems with up to three-body interactions, parameters trained on small instances and transferred to systems an order of magnitude larger improve the sampled energy distribution only up to intermediate depths, indicating a fundamental limit of parameter concentration as a transfer strategy. By extending the training itself with TN simulations on larger system sizes, we avoid local minima and obtain lower-energy samples. Analyses of entanglement growth and importance sampling show that the simulation remains classically feasible with moderate bond dimension. We find that parameter concentration also persists on square lattices, albeit at substantially higher computational cost to perform reliable sampling. Overall, our TN framework not only provides an efficient and controlled framework for benchmarking variational quantum algorithms on two-dimensional lattices, but also serves as an effective surrogate model for training variational algorithms.

**Authors:** Rajdeep Paul, Prabuddha Roy, A. K. Pan

**Abstract:** We present a hitherto unexplored semi-device-independent (SDI) self-testing protocol designed to certify unitary operations within a variant of prepare-measure framework. We consider a communication game which we refer to as a variant of $3$-bit prepare-measure random access code (PMRAC) involving two parties, Alice and Bob, who share a prior two-qubit quantum state. Alice encodes her message by applying unitary operations on her subsystem and sends it to Bob. To decode the message, Bob performs a measurement on the whole system. We demonstrate that the optimal quantum advantage of the variant of $3$-bit PMRAC over the classical bound enables the self-testing of Alice's unitary operations and Bob's measurements. The derivation of the optimal quantum success probability is fully analytical. The approach is so elegant that it can be generalized for any arbitrary $n$-bit PMRAC and may also be extended to other prepare-measure communication games.

**Authors:** Sahil Khan, Sayam Sethi, Kaavya Sahay, Yingjia Lin, Jude Alnas, Suhas Kurapati, Abhinav Anand, Jonathan M. Baker, Kenneth R. Brown

**Abstract:** Recent advancements in neutral atom platforms have enabled exploration of early fault-tolerant (FT) architectures for applications with quantum advantage, such as quantum dynamics simulations. An efficient fault-tolerant architecture has both spatially efficient quantum error correction codes (low qubit overhead), and efficient methodologies (transversal based gates, extractor based gates, etc.) for logical computation, to minimize overall execution time. Achieving the right balance between space and time can be critical for enabling early FT demonstrations of quantum advantage. In this work, we identify bottlenecks in existing spatially efficient schemes, which tend to be very serial, and do not take advantage of unutilized space. We introduce a teleportation-based scheme that leverages the reconfigurable connectivity of neutral atoms to parallelize logical operations. Our approach achieves up to \textbf{$\mathbf{\sim 3 \times}$ speedup} over extractor architectures at no extra space cost and achieves the best spacetime performance among other viable architectures before accounting for external \textit{resource-states}. To rigorously evaluate performance, we construct explicit quantum advantage benchmarks and \textit{simulate} compilation to a fault-tolerant instruction set, including low-level gate scheduling and shuttling patterns, and resource-state nondeterminism. We find that our speedups still apply and report exact space-time cost along with success probabilities, identifying architectures capable of achieving quantum advantage \textbf{with as little as $\mathbf{11,495}$ atoms and a runtime of $\mathbf{\sim 15}$ hours}.

## 65. An efficient framework for quantum dynamics driven by nonclassical light
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-24 | **Relevance Score:** 0.272
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Sheng-Wen Li, Zeyang Liao, Mao-Xin Liu

**Abstract:** Understanding quantum system dynamics driven by nonclassical light pulses is challenging, particularly for general light states with large photon numbers. Here we introduce an efficient framework that makes this task tractable. By introducing a pulse-shaped P-representation, the exact quantum evolution is decomposed into a mixture of many independent quasi-classical branches, each governed by a standard master equation with a classical pulse which can be solved efficiently. As an illustration, for a two-level system interacting with an exponential pulse, we first find out the exact analytical solutions to the Bloch equations in each quasi-classical branch, and then by taking proper P-function average over all branches, the full system dynamics driven by nonclassical light pulses is analytically obtained. For the one-photon and two-photon cases, our method well reproduces the previous exact results either analytically or numerically. Crucially, our approach scales efficiently to more complex light states (Fock, thermal, squeezed vacuum states) with large photon numbers ($N\sim 100$). We further provide a clear physical interpretation how the system dynamics is influenced through the high-order optical coherence of the nonclassical pulses. This work provides a unified and computationally efficient route and a useful starting point to explore more complex quantum dynamics driven by nonclassical light in quantum optics and quantum information processing.

**Authors:** Wenbo Sun, Zubin Jacob

**Abstract:** Symmetry-resolved spectroscopies, such as angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and polarization-resolved Raman, are central for quantum material characterization, yet remain challenging at nanoscale dimensions and low frequencies. Here, we propose correlated quantum dephasometry, which enables symmetry resolved quantum noise spectroscopy of materials at nanoscale and low ($\sim$MHz) frequencies via correlated dephasing of two spin qubits near materials. Our approach leverages the finite-range spatial structures of nonlocal near-field noise correlations to isolate rotational symmetry of the material response in momentum space beyond single qubit capabilities. We apply our approach to two-dimensional (2D) superconductors, and predict clear fingerprints that discriminate s-, d-, and g-wave symmetry of the superconducting gap. To highlight the generality, we further show that the same framework resolves 2D s-wave antiferromagnets and d-wave altermagnets. Our results establish correlated quantum dephasometry as a nanoscale, low-frequency complement for symmetry-resolved spectroscopy applicable to a broad class of quantum materials.

**Authors:** Soham Sen, Sunandan Gangopadhyay, Vlatko Vedral

**Abstract:** The eigenstates of two test-masses (where each test-mass is placed inside of a harmonic trap) separated by a distance, can get entangled where gravity acts as the mediator of entanglement and it has been argued in \href{https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2511.07348}{arXiv:2511.07348 [quant-ph]} that this entanglement of masses cannot be generated without the underlying quantum nature of gravity. In this work, we consider two non-relativistic Bose-Einstein condensates (formed inside of harmonic trap potentials with identical trapping frequencies) separated by a distance. We take a linearized quantum gravity model and investigate the generation of entanglement while gravitons serve as the mediator of entanglement. The entanglement is generated between the phonon modes of the two condensates, and we observe that for very low separation distance, the entanglement generated is significantly higher than that observed for the quantum gravity induced entanglement of masses or QGEM protocol; however, the fall of entanglement is faster than the two-particle case for two separated Bose-Einstein condensates. We observe that when the number of particles in the condensate is increased, the degree of entanglement for a smaller separation distance becomes substantially higher compared to the case discussed in \href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.105.106028}{Phys. Rev. D 105 (2022) 106028}, which allows for a more robust experimental proposal using this quantum gravity induced entanglement of phonons or QGEP protocol.

**Authors:** Lukas Burgholzer, Marcel Walter, Patrick Hopf, Álvaro Caride-Tabarés Sánchez, Teemu Mattsson, Bernd Hoffmann, Noora Färkkilä, Daniel Bulmash, Robert Wille, Eric Mansfield

**Abstract:** Quantum computers are moving into HPC centers, and the main challenge is now integration rather than pure hardware access. Many current software paths still depend on vendor-specific adapter chains between user SDKs, schedulers, and backend APIs. This pattern makes operations more complex than necessary and slows the transition from pilots to production workflows. We present a practical integration path centered on the Quantum Device Management Interface (QDMI). Using IQM superconducting systems as a hardware case study, we implement an IQM-backed QDMI layer and connect it to two software layers that HPC centers working with quantum computers already care about: Slurm-based job execution and Qiskit-facing user workflows. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/iqm-finland/QDMI-on-IQM. The key message is simple: integrating quantum hardware into HPC does not have to be a bespoke engineering effort for each backend. Once the software-hardware boundary is standardized, large parts of the stack become reusable across providers and deployment styles. Our results do not claim that standardization eliminates all HPCQC challenges. They show that this specific boundary can already be standardized today in a way that is practical for users, operators, and vendors.

**Authors:** Joshua Courtney

**Abstract:** Quantum computation is an attractive front for many problems that are intractable for computers today. One such problem is nonadiabatic quantum molecular dynamics, where quantized internal states coupling to parameterized modes result in a Hamiltonian resistant to oracle-based models and spectral decomposition. This dissertation applies diabatic Hamiltonian operators directly to the computational basis as first-quantized split-operator propagators, validated with dynamic observables including absorption and recurrence spectra, scattering cross-sections, population dynamics, and quantum scars. Circuits are derived and specified, with focused circuit optimization in multi-mode and multi-channel extensions, including multivariate potential energy terms and graph theoretic optimization from molecular symmetry. Resource estimation shows circuit depth advantage against QROM-loading architectures on a fault-tolerant scale, and a quantitative comparison against quantum signal processing variants confirms that a Trotter-based architecture retains a scalable T-gate advantage. Expanding beyond electronic states demonstrates that duality between finite basis and discrete variable representations permits congruent structural decompositions into quantum circuits, expanding the use of multi-channel dynamics far beyond chemistry.

## 70. Boundary-Aware Stabilizer Scheduling for Distributed Quantum Error Correction

**Authors:** Sanidhya Gupta, Sanidhay Bhambay, Narges Alavisamani, Neil Walton, Thirupathaiah Vasantam

**Abstract:** Future quantum architectures are expected to be modular, with quantum processors connecting multiple quantum processing units (QPUs) via photonic interconnects. In topological quantum error correction, such as color codes, this creates seam boundaries where parity checks require remote CNOT operations using heralded Bell pairs. These non-local checks are slower and noisier than bulk local checks because entanglement generation is probabilistic, causing data qubits to accumulate idle noise while waiting for remote operations. A natural way to reduce this overhead is to skip some seam measurements; however, doing so makes seam syndrome information stale and can degrade decoding. The central scheduling problem is therefore to determine how frequently seam checks should be measured so as to balance remote-operation and waiting noise against syndrome staleness. To address this trade-off, we develop a scheduling module that integrates directly into standard syndrome-extraction circuits. We consider two policies: Skip-Seam-$τ$ (SS-$τ$), which measures all bulk checks every round while measuring seam checks once every $τ$ rounds and copying the most recent syndrome in skipped rounds, and Adaptive Skip-$τ$ (AST), which selects $τ$ as a function of code distance and entanglement generation rate (EGR). We evaluate these policies on triangular color codes under circuit-level noise in Stim, including idling errors induced by Bell-pair generation delays. Our simulations show that SS-tau and AST reduce remote-operation overhead and can lower the logical error rate (LER) relative to the Measure-All (MA) baseline. For physical error rate $p = 10^{-3}$, we identify an EGR regime in which both SS-$τ$ and AST exhibit behavior consistent with fault-tolerant scaling, with LER decreasing as code distance increases. Across these regimes, SS-$τ$ and AST outperform MA.

## 71. On the importance of hyperparameters in initializing parameterized quantum circuits
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-23 | **Relevance Score:** 0.266

**Authors:** Ankit Kulshrestha, Sarvagya Upadhyay

**Abstract:** There has been intensive research on increasing the utility and performance of Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQCs) in the past couple of years. Owing to this research, there are now several inductive biases available to a quantum algorithms researchers to design a good circuit for their chosen task. In this paper, we focus on the problem of finding performant initial parameters for a given PQC. Different from previous research that focuses on finding the right \emph{distribution}, we focus on finding the \emph{hyperparameters} for any given distribution. To that end we introduce an evolutionary-search based algorithm that finds optimal hyperparameter given a PQC and quantum task. Our empirical results indicate that our algorithm consistently leads to selection of performant initial parameters tuned specifically to the ansatz and the quantum task leading to faster convergence and performance. More importantly, our algorithm does not \emph{negatively} affect the barren plateau phenomenon. In other words, the initial parameters suggested by algorithm do not worsen the gradient variance scaling for a given initializing distribution.

## 72. Distributed Quantum-Enhanced Optimization: A Topographical Preconditioning Approach for High-Dimensional Search
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-22 | **Relevance Score:** 0.265

**Abstract:** Optimization problems become fundamentally challenging as the number of variables increases. Because the volume of the search space grows exponentially, classical algorithms frequently fail to locate the global minimum of non-convex functions. While quantum optimization offers a potential alternative, mapping continuous problems onto near-term quantum hardware introduces severe scaling limits and barren plateaus. To bridge this gap, we propose the Distributed Quantum-Enhanced Optimization (D-QEO) framework. Instead of forcing the quantum processor to find the exact minimum, we use it simply as a topographical preconditioner. The QPU maps the landscape to locate the most promising basin of attraction, generating high-quality seed points for a classical GPU-accelerated solver to refine. To make this approach viable for utility-scale problems, we exploit the mathematical structure of separable functions. This allows us to cut a 50-qubit (i.e., $2^{50}$) global search space into independent and manageable sub-spaces using 5-qubit subcircuits. By executing these fragments concurrently with CUDA-Q, we completely bypass the overhead of cross-register entanglement and classical tensor knitting for separable functions. Benchmarks on the 10-dimensional Rastrigin and Ackley functions show that D-QEO prevents the exponential failure rates observed in purely classical algorithms. Furthermore, this quantum warm-start significantly reduces the number of classical BFGS iterations required to converge, providing a highly practical blueprint for utilizing near-term quantum resources in complex global search.

## 73. High-dimensional GHZ-based multi-party quantum key agreement: rigorous security, fairness, and loss tolerance

**Authors:** Hamza Sohail, Burhan Ul Islam Khan, Nur Fatin Liyana Mohd Rosely, Khang Wen Goh, Dwi Sudarno Putra, Abdul Raouf Khan, Mesith Chaimanee

**Abstract:** Abstract Multi-party quantum key agreement (MQKA) enables a group of mutually untrusted users to jointly establish a secret key with equal influence, a capability not provided by two-party quantum key distribution (QKD) and increasingly relevant for securing resilient infrastructure such as quantum-enabled smart grid networks and distributed cyber-physical systems. We present a high-dimensional Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-based MQKA that simultaneously targets rigorous security, provable fairness, and practical loss tolerance. The protocol distributes an N -partite d -level GHZ state in a star (with an optional star-of-stars hierarchy for large N ) and maps each user’s contribution to local $X_{d}^{a} Z_{d}^{b}$ X d a Z d b operations. A commit-then-reveal layer makes inputs binding and hiding, yielding equal influence fairness over $\mathbb{Z}_{d}$ Z d with a strict fair-abort guarantee. Composable secrecy is established via entropy bounds and a Devetak-Winter-style key rate analysis, strengthened by test-round statistics; we connect Mermin/Svetlichny-type correlators to min-entropy lower bounds and incorporate full leakage accounting and finite-key penalties. We model depolarizing, shift/phase (Weyl), amplitude-damping, erasures, detector efficiency, and dark counts, and derive closed-form mappings from device parameters to symbol/phase errors. Monte Carlo studies confirm that $d&gt;2$ d &gt; 2 expands the positive-rate region and reduces the global survival required for a given throughput compared with qubit GHZ MQKA under identical conditions. We discuss potential photonic realizations (time-bin or frequency-bin encoding, discrete Fourier transform networks, and superconducting nanowire detectors) and architectural pathways toward larger N via hierarchical clustering, while acknowledging the significant technological challenges that would need to be overcome to realize high-dimensional multipartite entanglement experimentally. Overall, the scheme delivers higher efficiency per entangled state, rigorous fairness, and composable security with realistic noise and loss, addressing key gaps in current MQKA designs for resilient infrastructure.

**Authors:** Z. M. McIntyre, Daniel Loss

**Abstract:** The use of noise-robust qubit encodings provides a way of extending the lifetime of quantum information at the hardware level. In this work, we introduce the spin Kerr-cat encoding, which leverages a clock transition in the spectrum of quadrupolar nuclei (having spin length $I\geq 1$) to achieve a first-order suppression of noise leading to qubit dephasing. The basis states of the spin Kerr-cat qubit are given by the two lowest levels of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric nuclear-spin Hamiltonian and are well approximated by spin cat states. We compute the dephasing time of the spin Kerr-cat qubit under a model of $1/f$ noise, as well as relaxation of the qubit due to breaking of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry by charge-noise-induced fluctuations of the quadrupolar tensor. Using measured parameters for antimony (${}^{123}\mathrm{Sb}$) donors in silicon, we estimate that a coherence time of $T_2^*=100$ s could be achieved with this encoding. We propose a two-qubit gate mediated by hopping electrons and estimate that with an enhancement of measured quadrupolar splittings by a factor of $\approx 4$, a gate fidelity of $99\%$ could be achieved for spin Kerr-cat qubits encoded in ${}^{123}\mathrm{Sb}$ nuclear spins, neglecting errors that impact the electron while it is being shuttled and read out.

## 75. Noise Reduction for Universal Hybrid Oscillator-Qubit Quantum Computation
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-21 | **Relevance Score:** 0.262

**Authors:** Mohammad Nobakht, Ivan Kassal

**Abstract:** Hybrid continuous-variable--discrete-variable (CV--DV) architectures process quantum information in bosonic modes and qubits, but noise limits their performance. To reduce the noise, existing DV error correction must be complemented by CV noise reduction. Existing CV noise-reduction schemes -- such as GKP-stabilizer codes -- can reduce CV noise, but only for Gaussian gates. Therefore, no current noise-reduction scheme can correct arbitrary CV--DV gates, including non-Gaussian ones. Here, we develop noise reduction for a universal CV--DV gate set, making it applicable to arbitrary CV--DV gates. We do so by introducing an ancilla qubit into a GKP-stabilizer code, allowing us to reduce the standard deviation of Gaussian displacement noise from $σ$ to $\tilde O(σ^2)$. To demonstrate the scheme, we show that it significantly reduces noise and improves fidelity in the preparation of non-Gaussian cat and Fock states.

## 76. Comparative study of high-$J_{c}$ and low-$J_{c}$ SFQ microwave generators for transmon control
**Source:** EPJ Quantum Technology | **Date:** 2026-04-27 | **Relevance Score:** 0.262

**Authors:** Hongxiang Shen, Wenhui Luo, Nobuyuki Yoshikawa

**Abstract:** Abstract Scalability of superconducting quantum processors is increasingly constrained by the thermal load and wiring overhead associated with room-temperature control hardware. Cryogenic control interfaces based on single-flux-quantum (SFQ) logic offer a potential route to alleviating these bottlenecks, although their dissipation depends sensitively on the Josephson-junction critical current and the underlying fabrication process. In this work, we comparatively investigate SFQ-synthesized microwave generators implemented in high- and low-critical-current processes, and evaluate their suitability for transmon qubit control through a combination of experimental characterization and hybrid QuTiP–JoSIM analysis. By modulating SFQ pulse intervals, we synthesize coherent microwave drives and obtain single-qubit gate fidelities above 99.9% at 10 mK in QuTiP-based simulations for both implementations. The low- $J_{\mathrm{c}}$ J c implementation exhibits reduced phase-noise-induced error, achieves higher gate fidelity within its valid bias window, and shows improved robustness against frequency detuning, while the high- $J_{\mathrm{c}}$ J c implementation maintains a lower broadband noise floor. Using an explicit model of thermal dissipation and circuit footprint, we further estimate the integration limits of cryogenic control channels. The results show that reducing the switching current substantially relaxes the cooling-budget constraint and increases the number of channels that can be deployed simultaneously. These results clarify the trade-offs associated with implementing SFQ microwave generators in different fabrication processes and provide practical guidance for the design of scalable cryogenic qubit-control interfaces.

## 77. Path integral formulation of finite-dimensional quantum mechanics in discrete phase space
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-22 | **Relevance Score:** 0.26
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Leonardo A. Pachon, Andres F. Gomez

**Abstract:** We develop a path integral representation for the dynamics of quantum systems with a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, formulated entirely within a discrete phase space. Starting from the discrete Wigner function defined on $\mathbb{Z}_d \times \mathbb{Z}_d$ (with $d$ an odd prime), and the associated Weyl transform built from generalized displacement operators, we derive an exact evolution kernel that propagates the discrete Wigner function in time. By exploiting the composition law of the kernel and iterating the short-time approximation, we obtain a sum-over-paths expression for the propagator weighted by a discrete phase-space action that is the natural finite-dimensional counterpart of Marinov's functional. For Hamiltonians linear in the phase-space coordinates, we show that the fluctuation sum factorizes and, at times strictly commensurate with the lattice (the Clifford-covariant regime), collapses to a deterministic shift realizing the discrete analog of classical Hamiltonian flow. The formulation is applied to a single qutrit ($d=3$) under a diagonal Hamiltonian, and to two interacting qutrits, where we show explicitly that the full entanglement dynamics -- captured by a closed-form expression for the linear entropy valid for all times -- requires the coherent contribution of all fluctuation sectors of the action. The $\tildeμ= 0$ sector alone is non-real at finite time step and collapses to a trivial (uniform) kernel in the continuum limit, failing to reproduce the entanglement dynamics in either regime. We discuss the relevance of this construction for semiclassical simulation of many-body spin systems and the characterization of non-classicality through Wigner negativity.

## 78. Generalized stochastic spin-wave theory for open quantum spin systems
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-23 | **Relevance Score:** 0.259
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Zejian Li, Anna Delmonte, Rosario Fazio

**Abstract:** We propose a semiclassical framework for solving open quantum dynamics in driven-dissipative spin systems. Our method consists of generalized spin-wave approximations tailored to describing quantum trajectories unravelled from the master equation, and generically applies to regimes beyond the reach of conventional spin-wave theories, including short-range interactions and local quantum jumps, enabling the efficient simulation of large-scale interacting spins. We illustrate the versatility of our framework by studying a variable-range driven-dissipative Ising model on a 2D lattice. When the dissipation acts along the drive axis, we find a continuous phase transition breaking the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, and demonstrate that the interaction range, when tuned from fully-connected to nearest-neighbour, profoundly alters the universality class of the criticality. With the dissipation along the interaction axis, we show the emergence of a first-order transition. Demonstrated with both state-diffusion and quantum-jump types of trajectory dynamics, our framework provides a powerful toolbox for the efficient semiclassical description of non-equilibrium dynamics and many-body phases in spin systems.

## 79. Ghost Degrees of Freedom Without Quantum Runaway: Exact Moment Bounds from an Operator Conservation Law
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-23 | **Relevance Score:** 0.259

**Authors:** Christopher Ewasiuk, Stefano Profumo

**Abstract:** We prove an exact quantum conservation law for a harmonic oscillator coupled to a ghost degree of freedom: a second classical conserved quantity lifts to a quantum operator that commutes with the Hamiltonian with no hbar corrections, yielding a rigorous, state-independent upper bound on the mean squared phase-space radius for all time and every quantum state with finite initial second moments. The proof uses only canonical commutation relations and the Leibniz rule; it requires no confining potential, no spectral assumptions, and no perturbative expansion. The interaction studied here is bounded and vanishes at large separations, the generic situation in effective field theory, yet this suffices to guarantee quantum stability in the sense of bounded second moments. Three independent numerical frameworks (Heisenberg picture, Schrodinger picture, and Fock-space diagonalization) confirm wavepacket confinement below the analytic bound, a real energy spectrum, and Poisson level statistics numerically consistent with an integrable structure. The absence of a confining potential means the proof is silent on spectral discreteness and the existence of a ground state; those questions, addressed for polynomial confining interactions in concurrent work, remain open for the interaction class studied here and represent the sharpest targets for future work. Ghost quantum instability is therefore not an inevitable consequence of a wrong-sign kinetic term but depends critically on the interaction structure.

**Abstract:** The present work focuses on the strong/weak interaction of many-body spin-systems with a cavity mode. It introduces the necessity of redefining the physical conditions determining the strong/weak coupling regime in those systems. In more complex systems, the effective coupling emerging from the collective dynamics may differ indeed from the actual coupling of each individual subsystem with the bosonic field. This is shown by highlighting some counter-intuitive dynamical effects properly related to the coupling regime: a Jaynes-Cummings dynamics emerging although a strong interaction is present. The universality of this result is demonstrated through the analysis of three distinct systems: a two-qubit, a two-qutrit, and an $N$-qubit chain quantum Rabi models.

**Abstract:** As quantum hardware scales toward fault tolerant operation, the demand for correct quantum error correction (QEC) circuits far outpaces manual design capacity. AI agents offer a promising path to automating this synthesis, yet no benchmark exists to measure their progress on the specialized task of generating QEC circuits. We introduce StabilizerBench, a benchmark suite of 192 stabilizer codes spanning 12 families, 4-196 qubits, and distances 2-21, organized into three tasks of increasing difficulty: state preparation circuit generation, circuit optimization under semantic constraints, and fault tolerant circuit synthesis. Although motivated by QEC, stabilizer circuits exercise core competencies required for general quantum programming, including gate decomposition, qubit routing, and semantic preserving transformations, while admitting efficient verification via the Gottesman Knill theorem, enabling the benchmark to scale to large codes without the exponential cost of full unitary comparison. We define a unified generator weighted scoring system with two tiers: a capability score measuring breadth of success and a quality score capturing circuit merit. We also introduce continuous fault tolerance and optimization metrics that grade error resilience and circuit improvements beyond binary pass or fail. Following the design of classical benchmarks such as SWE-bench, StabilizerBench specifies inputs, verification oracles, and scoring but leaves prompts and agent strategies open. We evaluate three frontier AI agents and find the benchmark discriminates across models and tasks with substantial headroom for improvement.

## 82. Toward designing workload-aware Surface Code Architectures
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-21 | **Relevance Score:** 0.251
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Archisman Ghosh, Avimita Chatterjee, Swaroop Ghosh

**Abstract:** Practical quantum advantage is expected to depend on fault-tolerant quantum computing, although the architectural overhead needed to support fault tolerance is still extremely high. Prior FTQC designs generally emphasize either fast logical-qubit accessibility at the cost of significant qubit overhead, or high logical-qubit density at the cost of added workload latency. We propose an architecture that balances these competing objectives by placing surface-code patches around an ancilla-centric region, which yields nearly uniform ancilla access for all data qubits. Building on this design, we introduce a new workload-driven placement method that uses the $T$-gate profile of an application to determine an effective floorplan. We further provide a reconfigurable optimization for reducing the latency of $Y$-gate measurements on a per-workload basis. To improve flexibility, we also study concurrent execution of multiple programs on the same architecture. Numerical evaluation indicates that our approach keeps cycles per instruction near the optimal regime while reducing the number of required data tiles by up to $\sim21\%$, and achieves up to $\sim90\%$ efficiency when running 10 programs concurrently.

**Authors:** Don Winter, Thiago L. M. Guedes, Markus Müller

**Abstract:** Execution of quantum algorithms on large-scale quantum computers will require extremely low logical error rates, which necessitates the development of scalable decoding architectures. Local decoders are promising candidates for this task, as they avoid the communication and data processing bottlenecks inherent in global decoding strategies. Cellular automaton (CA) decoders represent a distinct class of local decoders, offering a path toward the low-latency, real-time decoding required for practical applications. In this work, we present SCALA (Signaling CA with Local Attraction), a novel non-hierarchical cellular automaton decoder for quantum repetition and toric codes. By evaluating SCALA alongside the hierarchical CA decoder proposed by Harrington, we provide a direct comparison between non-hierarchical and renormalization-group-style local decoding strategies. We characterize SCALA across three key metrics: Performance, scalability, and robustness. Our results show that SCALA achieves a code-capacity threshold of approximately $p_c\approx 7.5\%$ and provides strong sub-threshold scaling of about $p_L\propto p^{d/4}$ on the toric code. In terms of scalability, our non-hierarchical design ensures that the local computational resources remain independent of system size, yielding a modular local architecture suitable for hardware implementation. Finally, SCALA demonstrates strong robustness to qubit measurement errors and noise within the decoder itself, a critical advantage for real-time decoding on noisy hardware. Our results establish SCALA as a high-performance, scalable, and robust local decoder for scalable quantum error correction.

**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-23 | **Relevance Score:** 0.249
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Fabio Borrelli, Giovanni Miano, Carlo Forestiere

**Abstract:** We investigate the reduced dynamics of two identical superconducting qubits capacitively coupled through a finite-length transmission line. Starting from circuit quantization, we derive a circuit Hamiltonian that naturally separates the line modes into even- and odd-parity sectors coupled to collective qubit operators. Depending on the hierarchy between the qubit frequency $ω_q$, the mode spacing $ω_{TL}$, and the coupling scale $ω_g$, the line acts either as a structured reservoir or as a discrete few-mode coupler. In the long-line continuum limit, each sector is described by a Drude--Lorentz spectral density and the dynamics is solved with the hierarchical equations of motion. Using the Breuer--Laine--Piilo measure, we identify the parameter region in which the reduced dynamics exhibits non-Markovian relaxation. In the short-line limit, the continuum description breaks down and the dynamics becomes respectively multimode or single-mode. This establishes a unified cQED picture of the dynamical regimes of finite-length transmission lines in superconducting-circuit architectures.

## 85. Quantum Eigenvalue Transformations for Arbitrary Matrices
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-21 | **Relevance Score:** 0.247
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Xabier Gutiérrez, Lorenzo Laneve, Mikel Sanz

**Abstract:** Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) and Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) provide an efficient framework for implementing polynomials of block-encoded matrices, and thus offer a systematic approach to quantum algorithm design. However, despite a number of recent advances, important limitations remain. In particular, QSP can only transform unitary matrices, by applying a polynomial to their eigenvalues, while QSVT is a singular-value transformation and thus one can only obtain the polynomial of Hermitian matrices. As a consequence, these techniques do not directly apply to an arbitrary non-Hermitian matrix that is not diagonalizable. In this work, we propose a simple yet powerful method to extend these ideas to arbitrary square matrices by acting on their eigenvalues. To this end, we introduce the notion of an $n$-regular block encoding, namely, a block encoding whose $k$-th power reproduces the $k$-th power of the encoded matrix for every $0 < k < n$. We show that applying QSP to any unitary with this property is equivalent to applying a polynomial of degree at most $n$ to the block-encoded matrix, independently of its internal structure. Moreover, we provide a simple construction that transforms any block encoding into an $n$-regular one using only $O(\log n)$ ancillary qubits and operations. Finally, we show that this construction induces the desired transformation on the eigenvalues associated with the Jordan normal form of the matrix.

**Authors:** Nguyen Duong Hoang Duy, Nguyen Trinh Dong, Vu Tuan Hai, Le Vu Trung Duong, Nguyen Van Tinh

**Abstract:** Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution (DIQKD) provides information-theoretic security by relying solely on the violation of Bell inequalities, eliminating the need to trust the quantum devices. However, practical implementations of DIQKD are highly sensitive to noise. Efficient error correction during the classical post-processing stage is important for improving the fidelity. This work investigates the impact of noise on the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) value and evaluates the effectiveness of Cascade error correction. The protocol is applied iteratively to correct errors via parity checking and binary search procedures. Simulation results show that noise significantly degrades the CHSH value, reducing the strength of nonlocal correlations required for secure DIQKD. Nevertheless, Cascade reduces the error ratio, and most corrections occur within the first several rounds. These findings highlight the importance of classical error correction in improving DIQKD systems.

**Abstract:** We study truncations of hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) for finite-dimensional open quantum systems. We prove that for finite-dimensional approximations constructed with a Schur-complement type of terminator, the spectrum converges to that of the full HEOM as the truncation depth increases. We also prove that this approximation is free of spectral pollution: sufficiently deep truncations do not produce spurious unstable modes, provided the exact HEOM is stable. We illustrate the results for the spin-boson model.

**Abstract:** Efficient resource allocation and optical switching promise high key rates, network adaptability, and cost reduction in repeaterless quantum communication networks. However, identifying optimal switching configurations remains a significant challenge due to the combinatorial complexity. We introduce a novel graph formulation to model the physical and logical structure of repeaterless quantum networks, enabling the systematic optimization of switching strategies. The problem is posed as a linear program and solved using a column generation approach. This method enables scalable computation despite the exponential number of possible network configurations. Our results not only provide a formal foundation but also a practical algorithm for the optimization of switching. Empirical tests confirm the solver's scalability with network size, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness and laying the groundwork for future optimization of quantum network control.

**Authors:** Sho Kubota, Kiyoto Yoshino

**Abstract:** This paper studies the search for a single arc in a graph using the Szegedy walk. Arc search can be interpreted as finding a quantum particle not only in its position but also with a specific internal state. The quantum walk employed in this study is essentially the model proposed by Segawa and Yoshie for the purpose of edge search. First, we investigate how the symmetry of a graph is reflected in its time evolution matrix, and provide a sufficient condition under which the success probability of the search is independent of the marked arc. In particular, we prove that if a graph is arc-transitive, the success probability is independent of the choice of the marked arc. Next, we analyze path and cycle graphs and show that the quantum search is ineffective for these graphs, whereas it performs well for complete bipartite graphs $K_{n,n}$. These results provide a theoretical foundation for studying arc and edge searches on various graphs, while also suggesting new problems concerning the eigenvalue analysis of edge-signed graphs in spectral graph theory.

**Authors:** Isaac Oliva-González, Lucy T. González, Oscar D. Lara-Montaño, Aldo I. Ramirez, Alberto Mendoza, Ilse María Hernández-Romero

**Abstract:** Abstract Black carbon (BC) is a critical short-lived climate pollutant with severe health and climate impacts, yet forecasting its hourly dynamics remains challenging due to nonlinear interactions between meteorological conditions and co-emitted pollutants. Accurate forecasting is particularly relevant in regions facing persistent air quality issues, where BC frequently exceeds recommended limits and poses significant risks to public health. This study develops a data-driven forecasting framework that integrates ensemble learning with hybrid quantum–classical neural architectures, benchmarked using 8760 hourly records from Santa Catarina in the Monterrey Metropolitan Area (Mexico). Ensemble methods provided the most reliable baseline, with XGBoost ( $\mathrm{R}^{2} = 0.80$ R 2 = 0.80 , RMSE = 614.32 ng m −3 ) and CatBoost ( $\mathrm{R}^{2} = 0.80$ R 2 = 0.80 , RMSE = 614.06 ng m −3 ) effectively capturing pollutant–meteorology dependencies. In contrast, a purely quantum neural network underperformed ( $\mathrm{R}^{2} = 0.62$ R 2 = 0.62 ), whereas its hybrid quantum–classical counterpart improved predictive accuracy ( $\mathrm{R}^{2} = 0.72$ R 2 = 0.72 ) and exhibited more stable convergence, highlighting the benefits of combining quantum representations with classical optimization under current hardware constraints. Dimensionality reduction through Principal Component Analysis (six components retaining 91% of variance) had a limited effect on ensemble models but reduced the ability of neural and quantum architectures to capture extreme pollution events above 3000 ng m −3 . These findings elucidate how machine learning architectures represent the temporal dynamics of short-lived climate pollutants and support the development of adaptive early-warning systems for air quality management. The proposed hybrid framework provides a reproducible and extensible basis for applying quantum computing techniques to environmental forecasting, establishing a methodological foundation for future quantum–environmental research.

**Abstract:** In continuously monitored quantum systems, the feedback protocol of García-Pintos, Liu, and Gorshkov reshapes the arrow of time: a Hamiltonian $H_{\mathrm{meas}} = r A / τ$ applied with gain $X$ tilts the distribution of measurement trajectories, with $X < -2$ producing statistically time-reversed outcomes. Why this specific Hamiltonian achieves reversal, and how the mechanism relates to score-based diffusion models in machine learning, has remained unexplained. We compute the functional derivative of the log path probability of the quantum trajectory distribution directly in density-matrix space. Combining Girsanov's theorem applied to the measurement record, Fréchet differentiation on the Banach space of trace-class operators, and Kähler geometry on the pure-state projective manifold, we prove that $δ\log P_F / δρ= r A / τ= H_{\mathrm{meas}}$. The García-Pintos feedback Hamiltonian is the score function of the quantum trajectory distribution -- exactly the object Anderson's reverse-time diffusion theorem requires for trajectory reversal. The identification extends to multi-qubit systems with independent measurement channels, where the score is a sum of local operators. Two consequences follow. First, the feedback gain $X$ generates a continuous one-parameter family of path measures (for feedback-active Hamiltonians with $[H, A] \neq 0$), with $X = -2$ recovering the backward process in leading-order linearization -- a structure absent from classical diffusion, where reversal is binary. Second, the score identification enables machine learning (ML) score estimation methods -- denoising score matching, sliced score matching -- to replace the analytic formula when its idealizations (unit efficiency, zero delay, Gaussian noise) fail in real experiments.

## 92. Loss-biased fault-tolerant quantum error correction

**Authors:** Laura Pecorari, Gavin K. Brennen, Stanimir S. Kondov, Guido Pupillo

**Abstract:** We investigate the limits of quantum error correction (QEC) in neutral-atom processors approaching high-fidelity gates and fast cycle times. We show that shorter QEC cycles amplify platform-specific errors, notably Rydberg excitation hopping, and hinder decay of residual Rydberg population, leading to non-Markovian correlated errors that degrade logical performance. To address this, we introduce loss biasing, where spurious Rydberg excitations are rapidly converted into atom loss via mid-circuit ionization, transforming errors into erasure-like noise and suppressing their propagation. Loss biasing restores the fault-tolerant logical error scaling for intra-cycle Pauli errors; furthermore, we argue that when supported with loss-aware decoding, it can achieve the optimal scaling of erasures while enabling shorter QEC cycles with reduced hardware overhead. We outline an implementation using fast autoionization in alkaline-earth(-like) atoms, establishing loss biasing as a practical route toward fault-tolerant quantum computing with sub-millisecond QEC cycles.

**Authors:** Caesnan M. G. Leditto, Angus Southwell, Muhammad Usman, Kavan Modi

**Abstract:** Higher-order networks with multiway interactions can exhibit collective dynamical phenomena that are absent in traditional pairwise network models. However, analyzing such dynamics becomes computationally prohibitive as their state space grows combinatorially in the multiway interaction order. Here we develop quantum algorithms for two central tasks -- synchronization estimation and certification of the no-phase-locking regime -- in the simplicial Kuramoto model. This model is a higher-order generalization of the celebrated Kuramoto model for coupled oscillators on graph-based networks. Under explicit assumptions on data access and types, and simplicial structure, we derive end-to-end quantum gate complexities and identify regimes with polynomial quantum advantage for synchronization estimation and super-polynomial quantum advantage for no-phase-locking certification over classical methods. More broadly, these results extend quantum algorithms for higher-order networks from structural analysis to nonlinear dynamical diagnostics, easing a major computational bottleneck and opening a route to quantum methods for probing higher-order phenomena beyond the reach of direct classical approaches.

**Authors:** Giulia Salatino, Anna Delmonte, Zejian Li, Rosario Fazio, Alberto Biella

**Abstract:** We characterize nonequilibrium phases in long-range dissipative spin systems through the statistical properties of quantum jump trajectories. While the average dynamics governed by the Lindblad master equation provides access to steady-state expectation values of order parameters, the quantum trajectory framework reveals features encoded in the spatial and temporal correlations of detection events. Focusing on a model exhibiting a paramagnetic-to-ferromagnetic phase transition, we investigate the full counting statistics of quantum jumps using a tilted Lindbladian approach. We combine this with cluster mean-field and cumulant expansion techniques, which allow us to capture, respectively, the short- and long-range structure of jump correlations. In addition, we study the waiting-time distributions of detection events. We show that quantum jump correlations display clear signatures of the underlying phases and reveal distinct dynamical features across the transition. Our results highlight the potential of trajectory-resolved observables as probes of collective behavior in open quantum many-body systems and provide new insights into the role of long-range interactions in shaping nonequilibrium dynamics.

## 95. Replica Tensor Train

**Authors:** Miha Srdinsek, Gabriel Gouraud, Xavier Waintal

**Abstract:** We describe a numerical many-body technique that is based on both tensor networks and quantum Monte Carlo. The variational ansatz is a tensor network that can harvest volume-law entanglement. It is constructed from a tensor train to which one applies a set of non-local operators that force several indices of the tensor train to represent the same physical index, hence its name -- replica tensor train (RTT). From the tensor network toolbox, it inherits the possibility to make linear combinations of these states and apply a certain class of operators. We can therefore find the ground-state of a local Hamiltonian in a purely algebraic way as in standard tensor network algorithms -- i.e. without using gradient descent methods. On the other hand, the volume-law structure forbids calculating physical observables directly. In much the same way as on a quantum computer where one can prepare a state but can only sample it at the end, here we have to use Markov Chain Monte Carlo to compute the observables. We further show that the approach can be extended to build Krylov-subspace ground-state methods within the variational manifold. We illustrate the different algorithms on a two-dimensional spin model with a transverse magnetic field, which can be solved by this approach at low computational cost.

**Authors:** Tim Alhäuser, Heinz-Peter Breuer

**Abstract:** We explore the performance of the time-convolutionless (TCL) projection operator technique using the Fano-Anderson model as a test case. Comparing the exact TCL master equation with an expansion in powers of the strength of the system-environment coupling, we analyze the transient dynamics as well as the steady-state behavior. For a Lorentzian spectral density we demonstrate that the dimensionless expansion parameter corresponds to the ratio of the environmental correlation time to the relaxation time of the system, and we derive the convergence radius for the TCL expansion, which is seen to depend on the ratio of detuning and width of the spectral density. We further study the quantum non-Markovianity of the model based on the evolution of the Bures distance between quantum states and how it is represented by the second and fourth order of the expansion. Our results highlight both the strengths and the limitations of the TCL formalism in capturing key features of open quantum systems and, in particular, the challenges of accurately describing strongly coupled systems and non-Markovian dynamics.

**Abstract:** The Dicke model (DM) serves as a paradigm for understanding collective light-matter interactions. We introduce the chiral Dicke model, a generalization where an atomic ensemble couples to a two-mode cavity via chiral interactions. Unlike the standard DM, the chiral DM is endowed with an inherent continuous $U(1)$ symmetry associated with angular momentum conservation. The ground-state phase diagram and the associated quantum phase transitions are charted out, revealing a $U(1)$-broken superradiant phase that spans a broad parameter space. We demonstrate that the spectrum of quantum fluctuations is highly tunable in both the symmetric and broken phases. Strikingly, our calculations reveal that the system exhibits `multiversality', where distinct universality classes govern the transition between the same two phases. In particular, along a special line in parameter space, the dynamical critical exponent for the normal-superradiant phase transition changes from $zν=1$ to $zν=1/2$. Our work establishes the chiral Dicke model as a powerful platform to realize novel quantum phases and multiversal critical phenomena in light-matter coupled systems.

## 98. Time-Uniform Error Bound for Temporal Coarse Graining in Markovian Open Quantum Systems
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-23 | **Relevance Score:** 0.237
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Teruhiro Ikeuchi, Takashi Mori

**Abstract:** Several approximation procedures, such as the full or partial rotating-wave, time-averaging, and geometric-arithmetic approximations, have been proposed to derive Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) generators from the Born-Markov quantum master equation (e.g., the Redfield equation). Establishing rigorous error bounds for these approximations is of fundamental and practical importance. However, existing bounds face two major limitations: they are highly specific to individual methods, and, more critically, they diverge in the long-time limit, ensuring the accuracy of the derived GKSL generator only in short-time regimes. In this Letter, we resolve both issues by deriving a unified, rigorous error bound for a general class of approximation methods -- termed temporal coarse graining -- that encompasses all aforementioned schemes. Crucially, our error bound is time-uniform. This guarantees that GKSL generators obtained via temporal coarse graining remain accurate for arbitrarily long times, provided the dissipation timescale is significantly longer than the bath correlation timescale.

**Authors:** Michael Reitz, Harsh Bhakta, Wei Xiong, Joel Yuen-Zhou

**Abstract:** We present a general and efficient approach to compute phase-resolved multidimensional spectra of anharmonic molecular polaritons, based on a semiclassical evolution of the molecular Hamiltonian and cavity field in the large-$\mathcal{N}$ limit of many molecules coupled to a confined photonic mode. By systematically expanding the response in both amplitudes and phases of the input fields, our method enables a transparent and computationally simple construction of phase-cycled two-dimensional single- and double-quantum polariton spectra from the underlying nonlinear signal components. Here, phase cycling acts as an analogue of phase matching with oblique pulses, allowing for the isolation of the contributing nonlinear pathways in Liouville space. We specialize to vibrational polaritons and benchmark the method through direct comparison with experimentally measured single-quantum spectra, providing an explanation for the longstanding puzzle of the polariton bleach effect observed at short waiting times. Further, we show how the imprint of various types of anharmonicities on the double-excitation manifold can be directly probed and analyzed through double-quantum coherence spectroscopy. Taken together, our results establish a practical and powerful framework for the modeling and interpretation of nonlinear spectroscopic experiments on strongly coupled light-matter platforms and for guiding the design of cavity-enhanced molecular platforms.

## 100. Rigorous Security Proofs for Practical Quantum Key Distribution
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-23 | **Relevance Score:** 0.233
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Devashish Tupkary

**Abstract:** This thesis is concerned with rigorous security analyses of practical Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols, using a variety of modern proof techniques. The main results are as follows. First, we establish a security proof for variable-length QKD protocols against IID collective attacks, and extend this result to coherent attacks using the postselection technique. In doing so, we resolve a long-standing flaw in the application of the postselection technique to QKD, thereby placing it on a rigorous mathematical footing. Second, we develop a method to bound phase error rates in entropic uncertainty relation-based and phase error rate-based proofs, using only the observed statistics of the protocol, even when detectors are imperfect and only approximately characterized. This removes a key assumption of identical detector behaviour and enables these techniques to be applied in realistic settings. Third, we present a very general security analysis based on the marginal-constrained entropy accumulation theorem. The resulting framework can be readily adapted to practical imperfections and side channels, and is suitable for certification efforts. Finally, we show that the security of QKD protocols under realistic authentication assumptions can be reduced to the standard idealized setting, where authentication is assumed to behave honestly, with only minor protocol modifications. A distinctive feature of this thesis is its unified presentation of several major QKD security proof frameworks using consistent protocol descriptions and notation. Consequently, this thesis is intended not only as a collection of new technical results, but also as a useful reference for understanding rigorous security analysis in quantum key distribution.

## 101. Odd Physics Off the Diagonal: Constraining CP-violating SMEFT with Quantum Tomography
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-23 | **Relevance Score:** 0.232

**Authors:** Avalon Roberts, Patrick Dougan, Alexander Oh, Savanna Shaw

**Abstract:** New sources of charge-parity (CP) violation beyond those described in the Standard Model (SM) are required to explain the observed matter--antimatter asymmetry of the Universe. The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) provides a framework to introduce additional electroweak sources of CP-odd physics in a model-independent manner. However, these CP-violating signatures are mostly degenerate to CP-even SMEFT operators in polarisation-blind observables, distinguishable only in the SM-New Physics (NP) interference using the azimuthal decay angle. Using Quantum Tomography techniques, we present a new approach to constraining these NP effects. Reconstructing the spin density matrix (SDM) of a diboson system, we go beyond `interference resurrection' to exploit the full signature of the Beyond-SM physics, including the pure quadratic NP terms. We show that this approach provides superior simultaneous sensitivity to characteristic features of CP-even and CP-odd contributions, including effects not fully captured by traditional angular observables.

## 102. Sufficient support size of measurements for quantum estimation
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-23 | **Relevance Score:** 0.23
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Koichi Yamagata

**Abstract:** In quantum estimation for a $d$-parameter family of density operators on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, an estimator is specified by a pair $\left(M,\hatθ\right)$, where $M$ is a POVM with a finite outcome set $Ω$ and $\hatθ:Ω\to\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is a classical estimator map. Since the number of outcomes $\left|Ω\right|$ is a priori unbounded, the space of admissible POVMs is vast, which makes the search for optimal estimators difficult. In this paper, for the minimization of the weighted trace of the mean squared error among locally unbiased estimators, we prove that it suffices to consider POVMs with at most $\left({\rm dim}\,\mathcal{H}\right)^{2}+d(d+1)/2-1$ outcomes, and that an optimal measurement can be chosen to be rank-one. For the minimization of the average weighted trace of the mean squared error in Bayesian estimation, we show that it suffices to consider POVMs with at most $\left( {\rm dim}\, \mathcal{H}\right)^{2}$outcomes, and again an optimal POVM can be taken to be rank-one. Furthermore, when the model admits a real sufficient subalgebra, we show that the $\left( {\rm dim}\, \mathcal{H} \right)^{2}$ term in the above support-size bounds can be reduced in both the locally unbiased and Bayesian settings. These bounds substantially reduce the search space for optimal measurements and justify restricting numerical optimization to rank-one POVMs with finitely many outcomes.

**Abstract:** We investigate the effects of coupling a quantum-magnetic cavity field to molecules. Our high-precision auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo calculations capture the effect of the cavity field in the presence of electron correlations, and their interplay and competition. In H$_2$, we find that a strong enough cavity coupling makes the original bound ground state metastable, along with inverting the singlet-triplet gap. In ring molecules (e.g., H$_n$), the magnetic cavity coupling stabilizes symmetric geometries. As a consequence, open-shell rings such as H$_4$, H$_8$, or C$_4$H$_4$, which would undergo Jahn-Teller distortions outside of the cavity, obtain exotic spin or ring-current polarized, antiaromatic ground states. These effects are enhanced by increasing the molecule concentration inside the cavity. Our results suggest cavity quantum electrodynamics beyond the long-wavelength approximation as a promising avenue for cavity-altered chemistry.

**Authors:** Yanis Le Fur, Javier Lalueza-Puértolas, Carlos Sánchez Muñoz, Alberto Muñoz de las Heras, Alejandro González-Tudela

**Abstract:** Bosonic quantum error correction enables hardware-efficient protection of quantum information by encoding logical qubits in harmonic oscillators. Bosonic grid states, such as Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states, are particularly promising due to their potential to correct small displacements and boson loss. However, their generation remains challenging, typically relying on probabilistic protocols or auxiliary qubit systems. Here, we propose deterministic protocols for generating bosonic grid states using programmable nonlinear bosonic circuits composed solely of squeezing, displacement, and Kerr operations. We show that aiming to enforce GKP symmetries in the output of these circuits yields states with competitive performance with respect to current realizations, but whose quality saturates with increasing circuit depth due to imperfect symmetry restoration. Instead, we find that these bosonic circuits naturally give rise to a distinct class of states, that we label as phased-comb states, which are unitarily related to standard grid states but feature an intrinsic phase structure. We demonstrate that these states define a scalable bosonic quantum error-correcting code with near-optimal performance under boson loss comparable to that of approximate GKP states. We further analyze their logical operations and show how to implement a universal gate set for them. Our results establish programmable nonlinear bosonic circuits as a viable route towards the generation of scalable bosonic quantum error-correcting states beyond standard GKP encodings.

**Abstract:** Belief propagation has recently emerged as a powerful framework for evaluating tensor networks in higher dimensions, combining computational efficiency with provable analytical guarantees. In this work, we develop the first end-to-end theory of tensor network belief propagation for a class of projected entangled pair states satisfying \emph{strong injectivity}. We show that when the injectivity parameter exceeds a constant threshold, BP fixed points can be found efficiently, and a cluster-corrected BP algorithm computes physical quantities to $1/\mathrm{poly}(N)$ error in $\mathrm{poly}(N)$ time for an $N$ qubit system. We identify a striking phenomenon we term \emph{algorithmic locality}: local perturbations of the tensor network affect the BP fixed point with an influence decaying rapidly with distance. As a result, updates to the fixed point after a local perturbation can be carried out using only local recomputation. Moreover, through the cluster expansion, this locality extends to observables, implying that local expectation values can be approximated from local data with controlled accuracy. Our results provide the first rigorous guarantee for the effectiveness of tensor-network belief propagation on a wide class of many-body states, bridging a gap between widely used numerical practice and provable algorithmic performance.

## 106. A four-player potential game for barren-plateau-aware quantum ansatz design
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-23 | **Relevance Score:** 0.226

**Authors:** Rubén Darío Guerrero

**Abstract:** We cast the design of parameterized quantum circuits as a four-player potential game whose state is a circuit directed acyclic graph (DAG) and whose players encode trainability, non-stabilizerness, task performance, and hardware cost. Per-player restricted action sets factorize the move space into append, remove, retype, and rewire operations; a block-coordinate $\varepsilon$-Nash residual $δ_\text{Nash}$ certifies that no single player can improve unilaterally. A single weight sweep on MaxCut $K_4$ traces a Pareto frontier from a Clifford endpoint $(M_2/n,\langle H\rangle)=(0,4.00)$ to a non-Clifford endpoint $(0.48,3.30)$. On three four-qubit hardware topologies (heavy-hex, $2\times 2$ grid, Rydberg all-to-all), Nash search achieves the highest mean potential; on the $2\times 2$ grid Nash reaches the theoretical ceiling $Φ_\text{max}=4.10$ on two of five seeds while the simulated-annealing baseline does so on one; paired Wilcoxon tests over five seeds cannot reject the null on any single topology ($p\ge 0.22$). On LiH/STO-3G, seeding Nash from a 58-gate Givens-doubles ansatz produces a 48-operation, depth-25 circuit retaining $97.7\%$ of the correlation energy while simultaneously reducing gate count, increasing non-stabilizerness, and controlling trainability. The framework is complementary to energy-only searches such as ADAPT-VQE and k-UpCCGSD, which reach chemical accuracy with fewer operations but do not optimize the other three axes.

**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Yuya Kawamata, Yuichiro Nakano, Keisuke Fujii

**Abstract:** Sampling problems are promising candidates for demonstrating quantum advantage, and one approach known as quantum-enhanced Markov chain Monte Carlo [Layden, D. et al., Nature 619, 282-287 (2023)] uses quantum samples as a proposal distribution to accelerate convergence to a target distribution. On the other hand, many practical problems are large-scale and constrained, making it difficult to construct efficient proposal distributions in classical methods and slowing down MCMC mixing. In this work, we propose a divide-and-conquer neural network surrogate framework for quantum sampling to accelerate MCMC under fixed Hamming weight constraints. Our method divides the interaction graph for an Ising problem into subgraphs, generates samples using QAOA for those subproblems with an XY mixer, and trains neural network surrogates conditioned on the Hamming weight to provide proposal distributions for each subset while preserving the constraint. In numerical experiments of Boltzmann sampling on 3-regular graphs, our method consistently accelerated mixing as the system size $N$ increased, with average improvements in the autocorrelation decay rate constant by speedup factors of about $20.3$ and $7.6$ over classical pair-flip methods based on nearest-neighbor and non-nearest-neighbor exchanges, respectively. We also applied the method to an MNIST feature mask optimization problem with $N=784$, obtaining faster energy convergence and a $2.03\%$ higher classification accuracy. These results show that our method enables efficient and scalable MCMC and can outperform classical methods for practical applications on NISQ devices.

**Authors:** Tian-Le Yang, Pei-Rong Han, Zhen-Biao Yang, Shi-Biao Zheng

**Abstract:** Dissipatively stabilized cat qubits are promising for fault-tolerant quantum information processing, yet their non-Hermitian (NH) spectral topology remains largely unexplored. We uncover rich Liouvillian exceptional structures in a cat-qubit mode stabilized by two-photon drive (TPD) and engineered two-photon loss, in the presence of single-photon drive (SPD) and single-photon loss. In the parameter space spanned by SPD strength and detuning, we identify both second- and third-order Liouvillian exceptional points (LEP2s and LEP3s). Remarkably, we show that the phase $θ$ of TPD provides coherent control over these exceptional points: the LEP3 diverges and vanishes at $θ=π/2$, while remaining stable and tunable elsewhere. We introduce a topological invariant based on the winding number of a resultant vector, which robustly identifies LEP3s with unit topological charge. Full master-equation simulations confirm that the system dynamics remains confined to the logical subspace with near-unity fidelity. Our results bridge dissipative stabilization, phase-coherent control, and NH topology, demonstrating controllable higher-order LEPs in open quantum systems.

**Authors:** Thomas J. Antolin, Jonas Glatthard, Andrew D. Armour

**Abstract:** Recent experiments on a range of engineered quantum systems have highlighted the important role of interacting two-level systems (TLSs) in modifying device properties and generating fluctuations. Focusing on the case of an oscillator coupled to a single near-resonant TLS, we explore how interactions between the TLS and lower-frequency thermally activated two-level fluctuators (TLFs) degrade the oscillator's coherence. Depending on the strength of the couplings, a single TLF can give rise to coherence oscillations that appear alongside, or supplant, Rabi oscillations of the oscillator-TLS system. Bath-driven transitions in the TLF cause irreversible coherence decay at a rate that is highly sensitive to both the couplings and the transition rate. For an ensemble of TLFs, we identify and characterise the different regimes of non-exponential phase-averaging-driven coherence decay that the oscillator can display. Using numerical calculations, we examine the extent to which systems with just a few TLFs differ from the limit of a large (continuum) TLF ensemble. Our work provides a theoretical framework for understanding the interplay of coherent TLS interactions and TLF-induced dephasing in quantum devices such as superconducting and phononic resonators.

**Authors:** Fintan M. Bolton

**Abstract:** The partial oracles framework is a quantum search algorithm that has the potential to exceed the quadratic speedup of Grover's algorithm, up to a theoretical maximum of an exponential speedup. Until now, however, the framework has lacked an explicit method for constructing the operator that represents the search iteration. In this paper, we provide the missing construction, for the special case of an oracle function definable using only in-place operations (that is, where the calculated result of the oracle function can be read just from the qubits in the search index). The restriction to in-place operations means that the current work does not yet exhibit quantum advantage: oracle functions constructed using only in-place operations are always classically reversible. To demonstrate quantum advantage, it will be necessary to extend this construction method to include out-of-place operations (part II). As part of the construction of the search iteration operator, we define a new type of transform, the reciprocal transform, which is applied to the oracle function. We show that the reciprocal transform obeys a chain rule, which makes it possible to break down complex transforms into simple steps. To illustrate the practical application of this search method, we apply the reciprocal transform to elementary operations from the SHA-256 hash algorithm: addition modulo $2^n$, the $Maj(a, b, c)$ function, the $Ch(a, b, c)$ function, and the bit shift functions. We also introduce the QFrame python library, which is used to automate the construction of quantum circuits that represent reciprocal transforms.

**Abstract:** High-precision optical phase stabilization in quantum networks is fundamentally constrained by the strict photon-flux and duty-cycle limits required to avoid disturbing fragile quantum states. This challenge becomes especially critical when coordinating multiple independent light sources for multi-step quantum protocols. Here, we develop an integrated phase-stabilization framework that incorporates a Bayesian phase estimator to optimally extract information from sparse single-photon detection events. This approach outperforms conventional maximum-likelihood estimation and achieves the shot-noise limit under minimal photon flux. The framework enables real-time correction of combined phase noise from both nodal lasers and transmission fibers, facilitating a two-step excitation protocol for heralded entanglement generation between separate trapped-ion nodes via single-photon interference. Operating with a detected photon rate of approximately 1 MHz and a duty cycle less than or equal to 6.5%, the system maintains interferometric visibility greater than 97% over fiber links of 10 km and 100 km. This phase control yields deterministic ion-ion entanglement with parity contrast exceeding 85% at both distances, enabling device-independent quantum key distribution. Moreover, the resulting memory-memory entanglement at 10 km survives beyond the average time required to establish it -- a fundamental requirement for quantum repeaters. This work establishes a robust and scalable foundation for practical long-distance quantum networks.

**Abstract:** Many real-world problems are naturally formulated as higher-order optimization (HUBO) tasks involving dense, multi-variable interactions, which are challenging to solve with classical methods. Quantum optimization offers a promising route, but hardware constraints and limitations to quadratic formulations have hampered their practicality. Here, we develop a distributed quantum optimization framework (DQOF) for dense, large-scale HUBO problems. DQOF assigns quantum circuits a central role in directly capturing higher-order interactions, while high-performance computing orchestrates large-scale parallelism and coordination. A clustering strategy enables wide quantum circuits without increasing depth, allowing efficient execution on near-term quantum hardware. We demonstrate high-quality solutions for HUBOs up to 500 variables within 170 seconds, significantly outperforming conventional approaches in solution quality and scalability. Applied to optical metamaterial design, DQOF efficiently discovers high-performance structures and shows that higher-order interactions are important for practical optimization problems. These results establish DQOF as a practical and scalable computational paradigm for large-scale scientific optimization.

**Abstract:** The Traveling Salesman Problem is a classical NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem that has been extensively studied in operations research. A major challenge in Traveling Salesman Problem formulations is the large number of subtour elimination constraints required to ensure a valid tour. To address this issue, we adopt an iterative approach grounded in well-established operations research techniques, in which subtour elimination constraints are generated dynamically. In addition, we integrate a preprocessing phase to reduce the number of candidate arcs. In this work, we investigate both classical and quantum optimization approaches for solving the problem using the proposed framework. In particular, for quantum optimization we analyze quantum annealing techniques within the D-Wave framework, considering both direct quantum execution on the QPU and hybrid quantum classical solvers. Computational experiments show that the proposed strategies significantly reduce the model size and lead to positive improvements in computational performance across classical, direct quantum, and hybrid optimization approaches.

## 114. Qubit-Scalable CVRP via Lagrangian Knapsack Decomposition and Noise-Aware Quantum Execution
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-24 | **Relevance Score:** 0.222

**Authors:** Monit Sharma, Hoong Chuin Lau

**Abstract:** Hybrid quantum optimization for vehicle routing faces a practical bottleneck: direct QUBO encodings of CVRP quickly exceed near-term qubit and gate budgets, while quantum evaluations are expensive, noise-limited, and sensitive to backend and circuit configuration. We address this gap with an end-to-end decomposition pipeline that converts CVRP into bounded-width quantum subproblems and treats quantum execution as a decision problem within the optimization loop. Starting from a Fisher--Jaikumar assignment linearization, we apply Lagrangian relaxation to dualize customer-assignment couplers, yielding independent per-vehicle knapsack subproblems that admit QUBO/Ising evaluation. To replace brittle subgradient tuning, we learn a multiplier-update controller using expert-guided pretraining followed by reinforcement-learning fine-tuning, with rewards based on execution-realized progress and route reconstruction. We also introduce a constrained contextual bandit as a hardware-aware execution layer that selects backend and circuit configuration with feasibility screening, enabling adaptation across heterogeneous noisy resources and parallel multi-QPU scheduling. Computational results on multiple CVRPLIB families show that the decomposition yields stable bounded-width subproblems across instance sizes, learned multiplier updates improve end-to-end routing quality relative to classical subgradient control under matched budgets, and hardware-mode configuration reduces median optimality gaps relative to static execution choices in our test set. We do not claim quantum advantage. Instead, the contribution is a practical end-to-end framework for scaling hybrid quantum CVRP optimization through OR decomposition, learning-augmented dual control, and adaptive hardware-aware execution.

**Abstract:** In this article, we prove that the quantum $f$-divergence between two normal states on a semifinite von~Neumann algebra is equal to the classical $f$-divergence between two corresponding classical states, which are called Nussbaum-Szkoła distributions. This result has been proved by the second named author and T.C.~John for normal states on the von~Neumann algebra $\mathbb{B}(\mathscr{H})$ of all bounded operators on a Hilbert space $\mathscr{H}$. We extend their result for normal states on any semifinite von~Neumann algebra, not only $\mathbb{B}(\mathscr{H})$.

**Abstract:** Achieving high-fidelity control in the presence of strong non-Markovian noise is critical for the optimization of emergent solid-state quantum devices. We present a highly efficient optimization framework that combines automatic differentiation with the non-Markovian uniTEMPO algorithm, enabling direct gradient-based optimization of complex objective functions. We apply this method to semiconductor quantum dots, optimizing multi-pulse excitation schemes: specifically Swing-UP of a Quantum EmmiteR (SUPER) and Floquet-engineered Two-Photon Excitation (FTPE) for single- and bi-exciton generation. Our approach yields high preparation fidelities within experimentally accessible parameter regimes. By integrating adiabatic rapid passage (ARP), we systematically enhance both SUPER and FTPE, demonstrating that these optimized protocols consistently outperform standard resonant pi-pulses and two-photon excitation. Notably, this performance gap widens at elevated temperatures, establishing the superior thermal robustness of our optimized multi-pulse strategies for real-world quantum hardware.

## 117. Scaling at Chiral Clock Criticality via Entanglement Renormalization
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-21 | **Relevance Score:** 0.22

**Authors:** Shiyong Guo, Brian Swingle

**Abstract:** We employ the Multiscale Entanglement Renormalization Ansatz (MERA) tensor network to investigate a critical line of continuous quantum phase transitions of the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ chiral clock model. This critical line is believed to be described by a slow renormalization group flow from the 3-state Potts fixed point to another fixed point that features anisotropic scaling of space and time. We use the variational principle to construct a MERA representation of the model's ground state, from which we obtain the ground state energy and the set of scaling operators and their scaling dimensions. These scaling dimensions determine the critical exponents of the model, and we study these critical exponents and other scaling data as a function of the model's chiral parameter. We find a set of effective scaling data that smoothly varies starting from the Potts data as the chiral parameter is increased. Within the context of our approach, we discuss how this result may nevertheless be consistent with the two fixed point hypothesis provided the renormalization group flow is sufficiently slow. Our findings demonstrate MERA's effectiveness in capturing the complex low-energy physics of the chiral clock model and in extracting field theory data for an anisotropic continuum theory.

**Authors:** Kosuke Nakanishi, Hiroshi Yano, Yuki Sato

**Abstract:** We present an explicit quantum circuit construction for Hamiltonian simulation of a first-order velocity--stress formulation of the three-dimensional elastic wave equation in homogeneous isotropic media. Previous studies have shown how elastic wave equations can be cast into forms amenable to Hamiltonian simulation, but they typically rely on black box Hamiltonian access assumptions, making gate complexity estimation difficult. Starting from the first-order velocity--stress formulation, we discretize the system by finite differences, transform it into Schrödinger form, and exploit the separation between the component register and the spatial register to decompose the Hamiltonian into structured tensor product terms. This yields explicit implementations of first-order and second-order Trotter formulas for the resulting time evolution operator. We derive corresponding error bounds and constant sensitive qubit and CNOT complexity estimates in terms of the discretization parameter, simulation time, target accuracy, and material parameters. Numerical experiments validate the proposed framework through comparisons with the exact time evolution and reconstructed physical fields.

**Authors:** Melchior Wirth

**Abstract:** We establish a relation between the exponential decay rates of quantum Markov semigroups with respect to different inner products. More precisely, it was conjectured by Fagnola, Poletti, Sasso and Umanità that for a Gaussian quantum Markov semigroup, the exponential decay rate with respect to the KMS inner product is bounded below by the exponential decay rate for the GNS inner product. We show that this is indeed the case and not limited to Gaussian quantum Markov semigroups, but holds for quantum Markov semigroups with a faithful normal invariant state on arbitrary von Neumann algebras. Additionally, the KMS inner product can be replaced by a whole class of inner products induced by operator monotone functions.

## 120. Quantum plasmonics with N emitters: bright hybrid continuum selection
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-23 | **Relevance Score:** 0.217
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Georgii Semin, Hans-Rudolf Jauslin, Gérard Colas des Francs, Stéphane Guérin

**Abstract:** We construct mode-selective effective models describing the interaction of the quantum plasmon-polariton field supported by a finite dielectric medium and one or several quantum emitters. The construction of the effective model is based on the decomposition of the field into bright modes relevant to the interaction with the emitters and dark modes, which do not interact with the emitters. We show that the quantum plasmon-polariton field can be represented equivalently by a double-continuum spectrum or by a single hybrid continuum spectrum for each emitter. The system of the electromagnetic field coupled to a finite medium is composed of two families of continuum modes, each of them with an infinite degeneracy. The two families are deformations of the free electromagnetic field and the free medium, induced by the interaction between them, as described by the Lippmann-Schwinger equations. We show that if there are $N$ emitters interacting with this plasmon-polariton field, the effective interaction involves a much smaller set of bosonic continuum modes: the interacting part of the continuum can be described by $N$ non-degenerate one-dimensional continua, one for each emitter. The representation of the interaction in terms of a single hybrid continuum spectrum coincides with the one within the macroscopic Langevin model with bulk medium. This coincidence is explained by an exact compensation of two terms, one in the coupling term of the Hamiltonian and the other one in a Green tensor identity.

## 121. Third Quantization for Order Parameter (I): BCS-BEC crossover with macroscopically coherent state
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-23 | **Relevance Score:** 0.216
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Guo-Jian Qiao, Miao-Miao Yi, Xin Yue, C. P. Sun

**Abstract:** We revisit the quantization of the order parameter, which we refer to as third quantization, from the perspective of the commutation relation between the phase operator of the order parameter and the particle-number operator. We show that this macroscopic commutation relation does not constitute an independent fundamental postulate added to quantum mechanics, but instead emerges naturally from second quantization in the thermodynamic limit for both bosonic and fermionic many-body systems. In this sense, both Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) and Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) states can be understood as macroscopic quantum states described by bosonic coherent states: in BEC, bosons condense into a single coherent mode with a well-defined phase, while in BCS systems, collective excitations of Cooper pairs can also acquire an effectively bosonic coherent description. On this basis, we propose a new macroscopic interpretation of the BCS-BEC crossover. To characterize this crossover, we model a conventional superconductor as an assembly of macroscopically separated superconducting segments. As the intra-segment coupling increases, the system evolves from a BCS-like regime toward a BEC-like regime, in which the segments collectively behave as macroscopic coherent states. Inter-segment tunneling then locks their phases, establishes global phase coherence, and gives rise to a bulk Bose-Einstein condensate. The phase diagram of the BCS-BEC crossover can thus be understood as a manifestation of a macroscopic quantum process governed by the coherent-state dynamics of the order parameter. Our results provide a unified perspective on BEC, BCS superconductivity, and the BCS-BEC crossover within the framework of third quantization.

**Authors:** Jan Bulling, Marit O. E. Steiner, Julen S. Pedernales, Martin B. Plenio

**Abstract:** Proposed experiments for gravitationally induced entanglement (GIE) typically suppress direct electromagnetic interactions between two massive particles by inserting a conducting Faraday shield. For superconducting particles, their large diamagnetism requires additional magnetic shielding to screen magnetic dipolar interactions. Here, we analyze the effect of residual particle-shield interactions and show that both Casimir and magnetic-dipole interactions can severely limit GIE tests by imprinting large phases. We quantify how run-to-run positional and orientational fluctuations of the setup elements, including the shield, trapping potentials, and detectors, convert these phases into effective decoherence, strongly reducing the detectable bipartite entanglement. In particular, we show that magnetic interactions between the particles and a superconducting shield constitute a major noise source, especially relevant for levitated superconducting particles. Treating the vibrational modes of the shield quantum mechanically, we further find that thermal vibrations generate persistent particle-shield correlations and can even mediate particle-particle entanglement that can mimic a gravitational signal. Finally, we derive quantitative thresholds on the maximum tolerable positional and orientational fluctuations of the setup elements required to observe entanglement, and propose mitigation strategies including geometry optimization and shield cooling to preserve a genuine GIE signature.

## 123. Valley-Aware Optimal Control of Spin Shuttling Using Cryogenic Integrated Electronics

**Authors:** Pau Dietz Romero, Nermine Chaabani, Lammert Duipmans, Alessandro David, Felix Motzoi, Stefan van Waasen, Lotte Geck

**Abstract:** Electron shuttling is emerging as a key mechanism for enabling long-range coupling in scalable spin-qubit architectures. Bringing shuttling waveform generation into the cryostat can improve scalability, but imposes strict area and power constraints on the control electronics. Concurrently, shuttling in Si/SiGe is further limited by a spatially varying valley splitting that induces spin--valley mixing and degrades coherence. Here, we make three contributions that address these limitations jointly: (i) an end-to-end co-simulation framework that combines disorder-informed valley maps with transistor-level cryogenic circuit simulations including electronic noise; (ii) a fully integrated cryogenic shuttling-signal generator tailored to velocity modulation, enabling period-wise waveform shaping through discrete circuit settings stored in on-chip memory; and (iii) a noise-aware optimization procedure that tunes only these implementable circuit controls, using one of four discrete resistor settings per period, to generate high-fidelity shuttling sequences. Across simulated valley and noise realizations in our co-simulation framework, the optimized velocity-modulation waveforms improve transport performance, achieving an average shuttling fidelity of $99.99 \pm 0.007\%$ at $v_{\mathrm{avg}} = 20~\mathrm{m\,s^{-1}}$ over a distance of $10~μ\mathrm{m}$, while maintaining active analog power consumption in the tens of $μ\mathrm{W}$ during shuttling. This validates on-chip storage and replay of optimized control settings as a practical strategy to mitigate valley disorder in scalable shuttling architectures.

**Authors:** Thiago T. Tsutsui, Danilo Cius, Antonio S. M. de Castro, Fabiano M. Andrade

**Abstract:** We analyze the quantum dynamics of the fractional-time Jaynes-Cummings model using a recent unitary framework for the fractional-time Schrödinger equation. We examine how the fractional derivative order $α$ influences non-classical features under different initial conditions. For an initial Fock state, fractional evolution introduces transient dynamics and heightened sensitivity to coupling strength. Through an inverse problem approach, we interpret these effects as arising from an effective time-dependent coupling with a strong initial pulse. For an initial coherent state, the fractional order tunes the system between dynamical regimes, with a transition at $α= 0.50 $ where standard collapse-and-revival is replaced by stable, periodic evolution. This regime enhances non-classical field properties, including stronger sub-Poissonian statistics, periodic quadrature squeezing, and the formation of Schrödinger cat states.

**Abstract:** Based on a consistent quantum microscopic approach, we investigate the peculiarities of collective polyatomic effects in atomic ensembles placed in a waveguide, caused by the presence of evanescent modes of electromagnetic field. We analyze the influence of these modes on the process of cooperative spontaneous decay, as well as on the nature of radiation transfer in the ensembles under consideration. We show that under certain conditions, their influence can be dominant compared to the role of radiation modes, and the mechanism for this influence is the modification of dipole-dipole interatomic interaction.

## 126. CVaR-Assisted Custom Penalty Function for Constrained Optimization
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-22 | **Relevance Score:** 0.206

**Authors:** Xin Wei Lee, Hoong Chuin Lau

**Abstract:** Constrained combinatorial optimization problems are frequently reformulated as quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) models in order to leverage emerging quantum optimization algorithms such as the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). However, standard QUBO formulations enforce inequality constraints through slack variables and quadratic penalties, which can significantly increase the problem size and distort the optimization landscape. In this work, we propose a slack-free penalty formulation for constrained binary optimization that eliminates auxiliary slack variables and preserves the feasibility structure of the original problem. The proposed approach introduces a nonlinear custom penalty function to enforce inequality constraints directly in the objective function. To address the computational challenges associated with evaluating nonlinear penalties in variational quantum algorithms, we employ the finite-sampling method that avoids the exponential complexity required by exact expectation computation. Furthermore, we integrate the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) objective to improve optimization robustness and guide the search toward high-quality solutions. The proposed framework is evaluated on instances of the multi-dimensional knapsack problem, a classical benchmark in combinatorial optimization. We showcase that the proposed custom-penalty formulation combined with CVaR sampling achieves improved optimality gaps and more consistent performance compared with conventional slack-based QUBO formulations. The results suggest that careful penalty design can play a critical role in enabling quantum and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for constrained optimization problems that arise in operations research.

**Abstract:** Early modular fault tolerant quantum computers remain constrained by costly inter-module communication and limited magic state factory service. Understanding such bottlenecks and investigating compiler optimizations most close the gap between algorithm requirements and hardware capabilities is a concrete and practically urgent systems problem. We study the modular architectures based on Bivariate Bicycle codes and identify the dominant bottleneck: inter-module communication induced by non-Clifford operations. We build a compilation pipeline to fill the missing parts of prior works and propose compiler optimizations: synthesizing arbitrary-angle rotations at the factory (syn@fac), transvection based Clifford deferral, and Clifford insertion for critical path duration reduction. We extend the evaluation scope of the prior work to 40+ benchmark categories drawn from PennyLane and MQTBench, including quantum algorithms and Hamiltonian simulations with varying sizes. Under the present instruction cost, syn@fac reduces estimated circuit failure probability by a factor of 9.0 on average across non-Clifford benchmarks. The robustness persists across sweeps of instruction cost ratios, LPU count, and factory count. Besides, transvection reduces Clifford deferral compile time by 77.04\%, while Clifford insertion reduces end-to-end circuit duration by 11.54\% on average on MQTBench, with smaller gains on Hamiltonian simulations. We hope this work inspires the studies on compiler optimizations for early modular FTQC systems.

**Authors:** Sameer Dambal, Eric R. Bittner

**Abstract:** This work investigates the emergent thermalization regimes in a chaotic Tavis-Cummings (TC) model and their implications in quantum spectroscopy. While the TC model is a cornerstone of cavity quantum electrodynamics, traditional treatments often overlook many-body effects that arise in the thermodynamic limit. We utilize the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis to demonstrate that a non-integrable excitonic Hamiltonian within the material manifold drives local thermalization. By tuning the polariton splitting $g$, we observe two dynamical regimes: a thermalizing regime at low interactions driven by quantum chaos and ergodicity, and a non-thermalizing regime at high interactions where strong coupling suppresses ergodicity. We further show that these regimes have direct implications on output photon statistics, specifically influencing the correlation times $τ_c$ of the cavity population and the second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(t+τ)$. We propose that entangled-biphoton spectroscopy serves as an ideal experimental platform to probe these effects and to allow the characterization of the underlying many-body exciton-coupling disorder $σ$ through coincidence measurements of the output. Taken together, these results exploit a naturally occurring many-body phenomenon to bridge theoretical predictions with experimental observables.

## 129. Random Access Codes: Explicit Constructions, Optimality, and Classical-Quantum Gaps

**Authors:** Ruho Kondo, Yuki Sato, Hiroshi Yano, Yota Maeda, Kosuke Ito, Naoki Yamamoto

**Abstract:** A random access code (RAC) encodes an $L$-bit string into a $k$-bit $(L>k)$ message from which any designated source bit can be recovered with high probability. Its quantum counterpart, a quantum random access code (QRAC), replaces the $k$-bit message with $k$ qubits. While upper bounds on the decoding success probability have long been studied in both classical and quantum settings, explicit constructions of optimal codes are known only in special cases, even for classical RACs. In this paper, we develop a constructive framework for classical $(L,k)$-RACs under both average- and worst-case criteria. We show that optimal code design reduces to selecting $2^k$ points in $\{0,1\}^L$ and $[0,1]^L$ for the average- and worst-case criteria, respectively, so as to minimize a distance-like objective. This characterization yields explicit constructions for general $(L,k)$. For $k=L-1$, we further obtain closed-form optimal encoders and decoders for both criteria, and show that the resulting classical $(L,L-1)$-RACs attain the corresponding proved upper bounds. We also show that these optimal classical codes induce $(L,L-1)$-QRACs that attain a conjectured upper bound on the decoding success probability. Numerical optimization suggests little difference between RACs and QRACs in the average-case setting, but a potentially large classical-quantum gap in the worst-case nonasymptotic regime.

**Authors:** Alexander Zlokapa

**Abstract:** Estimating local observables in Gibbs states is a central problem in quantum simulation. While this task is BQP-complete at asymptotically low temperatures, the possibility of quantum advantage at constant temperature remains open. The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model is a natural candidate: at any constant temperature, its Gibbs states have polynomial quantum circuit complexity and are not described by Gaussian states. Rigorous analyses of the SYK model are difficult due to the failure of known techniques using random matrix theory, cluster expansions, and rigorous formulations of the quantum path integral and replica trick. Despite this, we give a rigorous proof of a quasipolynomial-time classical algorithm that estimates SYK local thermal expectations at sufficiently high constant temperature. Our result introduces a new Wick-pair cluster expansion that we expect to be broadly useful for disordered quantum many-body systems.

**Authors:** Keisuke Kataoka, Yoshihito Kuno, Takahiro Orito, Ikuo Ichinose

**Abstract:** We study how the color code under decoherence gives rise to an intrinsic mixed-state topological order (imTO), which has no counterpart in pure ground states of local gapped Hamiltonians. For decoherence induced by XX-type operators on red links of the honeycomb lattice, we show that the resulting mixed state inherits half of the topological properties of the color code, including anyon content, logical operators, and topological entanglement structure. Using a gauging procedure for mixed stabilizer states, we identify the emergent phase as closely related to a single toric code. We characterize this phase by topological entanglement negativity (TEN) and perform efficient stabilizer-formalism simulations. While the pure color code has ${\rm TEN} = 2 \ln 2$, the maximally decohered state has ${\rm TEN} = \ln 2$, indicating emergence of a single toric code. By tuning the decoherence strength, we find a smooth crossover in TEN accompanied by a pronounced, nearly system-size-independent peak in its variance. We further show that the negativity exhibits characteristic scaling only for subsystem partitions commensurate with the triangular lattice of the emergent toric code. Our results demonstrate that negativity-based quantities provide powerful probes of mixed-state topological order generated by decoherence.

**Authors:** M. García Olmos, Y. Baba, R. A. Molina, M. Amado

**Abstract:** Proximity-induced superconductivity in low-dimensional systems offers a powerful pathway to engineer topological superconducting phases in, otherwise, non-superconducting systems. These exotic phases are of fundamental and technological interest due to the presence of robust zero-energy modes, the Majorana bound states. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework to realize Majorana bound states from the edge states of a two-dimensional semi-Dirac system. This anisotropic system, under specific conditions, can host non-chiral edge states that propagate only along particular edges, effectively forming separated one-dimensional channels. We show that the interplay between Rashba spin-orbit coupling and a Zeeman field on this setup provides the right conditions to get an effective p-wave pairing between the edge states by proximity with a s-wave superconductor. In finite geometries, each edge can independently undergo a topological phase transition into a one-dimensional topological superconductor and give rise to four zero-energy modes localized at the strip corners. At low energies, the edge states subspace admits a description in terms of coupled Kitaev chains, providing a clear picture of the origin, robustness, and tunability of the corner Majorana modes. Our results establish semi-Dirac materials as a natural platform for realizing Majorana modes in two dimensions without relying on engineered nanostructures, vortices, or crystalline higher-order topology.

**Abstract:** Abstract Young's modulus is a key parameter for evaluating the mechanical properties of materials and holds significant reference value in engineering material selection. Its measurement is also a classic experimental project in university physics courses. Based on the Mach-Zehnder interference principle, this paper designs and fabricates a sensitivity-adjustable Young's modulus measuring instrument by introducing two pairs of triangular wedges with adjustable apex angles and fillable media into the two interference optical paths. This enables the measurement of materials with Young's moduli spanning several orders of magnitude on a single device. The paper first presents the structural design schematic of the instrument and clarifies the definition and adjustment mechanism of sensitivity through analysis of the interference optical path. Subsequently, actual measurements were conducted on materials with significantly different moduli, such as steel wire, aluminum wire, and nylon rope, using the instrument. The relative errors of the experimental results were all below 1.6%, demonstrating the good robustness of the designed instrument. The design concept and experimental methodology presented in this study can provide a reference for the instructional design of experiments related to micro-displacement measurement in university physics laboratory teaching.

**Abstract:** Quantum computing may speed up numerical problems involving large matrices that are demanding for classical computers, and active research on this possibility is ongoing. In this work, we propose quantum algorithms for the exact simulation of a normalised correlated Gaussian random vector $|x\rangle=\vec{x}/\lVert\vec{x}\rVert$, $\vec{x}\sim\mathcal{N}(0,Σ)$, and its exponentiation $|e^{\vec{x}} \rangle= e^{\vec{x}}/\lVert e^{\vec{x}}\rVert$. When an $O(\mathrm{polylog} N)$-gate-depth quantum data loader for the covariance matrix $Σ\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times N}$ is available, preparing $|x\rangle$ and $|e^{\vec{x}}\rangle$ require $\widetilde{O}\left(\frac{\lVertΣ\rVert_F}{λ_{\max}}κ^{1.5}\right)$ and $\widetilde{O}\left(\lVert\vec{x}\rVert\frac{\lVertΣ\rVert_F}{λ_{\max}}κ^{1.5}\right)$ elementary gate depth respectively, where $\lVertΣ\rVert_F$, $λ_{\max}$, $κ$ denote the Frobenius norm, maximal eigenvalue, and condition number of $Σ$. Motivated by financial applications, we provide an end-to-end resource analysis when $\vec{x}$ represents a sample path of a Riemann-Liouville or standard fractional Brownian motion, or of a stationary fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. As a concrete example, we construct the quantum state encoding the rough Bergomi variance process and analyse the extraction of the integrated variance via quantum amplitude estimation. Under specific conditions, the dependence of $\lVertΣ\rVert_F/λ_{\max}$ and $κ$ on $N$ is small, and subcubic complexity in $N$ is achieved, indicating a quantum advantage over classical Cholesky-based sampling methods. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first quantum algorithmic framework for the amplitude encoding of exponentiated Gaussian processes, providing foundational primitives for quantum-enhanced financial modelling.

**Abstract:** We show that the construction of the linear interferometer in the Supplemental Material of arXiv:1909.09581 is flawed, leading to a generally suboptimal solution. We then provide the correct derivation of the optimal interferometric configuration that achieves the quantum Fisher information limit for imaging N weak incoherent emitters.

## 136. Stochastic Krylov Dynamics: Revisiting Operator Growth in Open Quantum Systems
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-22 | **Relevance Score:** 0.185
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Arpan Bhattacharyya, S. Shajidul Haque, Jeff Murugan, Mpho Tladi, Hendrik J. R. Van Zyl

**Abstract:** In closed quantum systems, Krylov complexity admits a geometric description; operator growth is equivalent to Hamiltonian flow in an emergent phase space whose structure is fixed by the Lanczos coefficients. We show that this picture survives, albeit in a fundamentally altered form, once the system is coupled to an environment.Using a Schwinger-Keldysh formulation of the full counting statistics of the Krylov position, we derive an effective action for operator growth under Lindblad dynamics. Even for the minimal case of dephasing, the phase-space dynamics ceases to be Hamiltonian; environmental coupling generates diffusion in the variable conjugate to Krylov depth, converting deterministic trajectories in to stochastic ones. The hyperbolic mechanism underlying exponential complexity growth is therefore broadened and, beyond a parametrically controlled scale, destroyed.This identifies dissipation as a relevant perturbation of the chaotic Krylov fixed point and reveals operator growth in open systems as a problem of stochastic dynamics in an emergent phase space.

## 137. Super-Heisenberg protocol for dark matter and high-frequency gravitational wave search
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-24 | **Relevance Score:** 0.183
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Wakutaka Nakano, Ryoto Takai

**Abstract:** We propose a quantum-enhanced sensing scheme for the detection of wave-like dark matter and high-frequency gravitational waves using two-dimensional ion crystals in a Penning trap. The protocol employs spin-motion squeezed states to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and enable a super-Heisenberg scaling with respect to the number of ions over a broad parameter range. We analyze the sensitivity of the protocol to representative wave-like dark matter candidates, including the axion-like particle and the dark photon, as well as to high-frequency gravitational waves, taking into account the decoherence and dephasing of the ion spins. Our results indicate that two-dimensional ion crystals and this new protocol provide a promising platform for probing previously unexplored parameter space in searches for light dark matter and high-frequency gravitational waves.

## 138. Composite quantum gates simultaneously compensated for multiple errors
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-23 | **Relevance Score:** 0.18
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Hristo Tochev, Nikolay Vitanov

**Abstract:** Systematic control errors remain a primary obstacle to realizing high-fidelity single-qubit gates. We introduce composite pulse sequences that implement X and Hadamard gates while simultaneously compensating amplitude (Rabi-frequency), detuning (frequency), and duration errors. Our construction uses two complementary strategies: (i) derivative-based cancellation of error terms in the full unitary (not just the transition probability), formulated via the Cayley-Klein parametrization, and (ii) direct minimization of the average gate infidelity over prescribed error ranges. We derive symmetric five-pulse solutions with closed-form phases that cancel all first-order terms (including the mixed derivative), and numerically optimize longer sequences -- up to 15 pulses -- to achieve higher-order suppression. We also show that standard ``universal'' five-pulse sequences (U5a/U5b) emerge as simple phase-shifted instances of our symmetric solutions, yielding broad robustness to both detuning and amplitude errors. Finally, we construct variable-area sequences for $R_x(π/2)$, which, up to virtual Z rotations, benchmark the Hadamard gate. Across all families we observe the expected trade-off between sequence length and robustness window, with substantial boosts in fidelity over large error domains.

## 139. HEOM-in-Calibration-Loop: Exposing Non-Markovian Bath Signatures That Markovian Calibration Elides in Superconducting-Qubit Tune-Up
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-23 | **Relevance Score:** 0.18
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Jun Ye

**Abstract:** Closed-loop superconducting-qubit calibration has matured into DAG-orchestrated protocol chains, yet published frameworks treat the bath via a Markovian master equation or a phenomenological likelihood, absorbing bath structure into fit residuals instead of reporting it as a diagnostic. We integrate a QuTiP 5.x hierarchical-equations-of-motion (HEOM) solver driven by a Tier-1 1/f Burkard bath into a multi-protocol calibration DAG (Rabi -> {Ramsey || T1}) and benchmark it against sesolve and mesolve on a frozen platform in a pulse-level simulator (no hardware validation). The Ramsey channel carries the headline: the Markovian fit is censored by its exponential-family numerical ceiling, while HEOM recovers a physical revival envelope whose primary T2* separates from the Markovian reference by at least 13x at 95% independent-bootstrap confidence within the HEOM-feasible budget; the point-estimate ratio reaches >=28x on the 50-point primary-t1 grid and ~72x on the 30-point biexp-family tau_aw pivot at L=5. Rabi contrast falls 2.17% below mesolve on a noise-limited 30-point grid; the paired-bootstrap CI crosses zero, so this channel corroborates rather than independently establishes the non-Markovian signature. T1 decay shape matches across backends (beta=1.000), yet HEOM's initial occupation drops from 1.000 to 0.879 -- a bath-dressed contamination stable under a 16-point densification. The DAG adds 9.62 us average per-protocol scheduling overhead, no meaningful latency penalty at protocol granularity. HEOM-in-loop thereby changes what calibration reports: bath structure appears as a quantifiable residual rather than a hidden confound.

## 140. Observation of quantum multi-Mpemba effect in a trapped-ion system
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-23 | **Relevance Score:** 0.18
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Gang Xia, Yu-Jie Zheng, Jing Huang, Chun-Wang Wu, Yi Xie, Ting Chen, Wei Wu, Weibin Li, Hui Jing, Jie Zhang, Yan-Li Zhou, Ping-Xing Chen

**Abstract:** The quantum Mpemba effect (ME) in Markovian systems is conventionally explained by a smaller overlap between the initial state and the slowest decay mode (SDM). Such state, initially farther away from equilibrium or steady state, relaxes faster than closer ones, resulting to a crossing of their trajectories. This picture, by neglecting the transient dynamics, holds in the long-time limit. Here we experimentally observe multiple trajectory crossings (multi-ME) in the relaxation dynamics of a trapped ion. Such novel dynamics takes place in a unusual scenario where the initial state instead has a larger overlap with the SDM. We develop a theoretical framework based on relaxation speed to understand the multi-ME. We show that the initial relaxation speed is governed by the fastest decay mode, which together with the SDM overlap gives a phase diagram that reveals both the occurrence and the types of quantum ME observed in our experiment. Our study goes beyond the simple picture based on the long-time limit, tracks continuously the quantum ME dynamics, and establishes a comprehensive framework to describe the transient quantum relaxation.

## 141. Attosecond Nonlinear Quantum Electrodynamics in Laser-Driven Plasmas via Two-Photon Synchrotron Emission
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-22 | **Relevance Score:** 0.179
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Vedin Dewan, Aleksei M. Zheltikov, Julia M. Mikhailova

**Abstract:** Ultrafast strong-field laser--plasma physics is shown to offer a promising framework for relativistic nonlinear quantum electrodynamics (QED). As one of its key advantages, this approach to relativistic nonlinear QED does not require an external beam of relativistic particles. Instead, high-energy electrons are produced in this setting as a part of ultrafast strong-field laser--plasma interactions. An intense ultrashort laser pulse generates and accelerates dense electron bunches to relativistic energies, giving rise to photon-pair emission confined to the nanometer scale in space and the attosecond scale in time. As a lowest-order nonlinear QED process, relativistic electrons in laser-driven plasmas are shown to give rise to attosecond bursts of two-photon emission, providing an ultrabroadband source of correlated photon pairs. As a physically insightful estimate, the rate of this two-photon emission is expressed via a product $ α^2 γω_{turn}$, where $α$ is the fine-structure constant, $γ$ is the Lorentz factor, and $ ω_{turn}$ is the local relativistic curvature frequency. Photon pairs with strongest correlations, providing a resource for photon entanglement, are emitted at a much lower rate, estimated as $ α^2 γ^2 ω_{turn} E_{\perp} /E_S$, where $E_{\perp}$ is the laser electromagnetic field, determining the transverse Lorentz force, and $E_S$ is the Schwinger critical field. Our study offers a clear guidance on how quantum aspects of laser-driven relativistic plasma electrodynamics can be isolated from their classical counterparts, enabling a physically justifiable approach to the analysis of nonlinear QED phenomena in complex laser--plasma interactions driven by ultrashort high-intensity laser pulses.

## 142. Adiabatic Error Cancellation in Berry Phase Estimation
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-22 | **Relevance Score:** 0.178
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Chusei Kiumi

**Abstract:** In this work, we show that Berry phase estimation admits a natural and universal adiabatic error-cancellation mechanism, making it a promising candidate for practical quantum computing before full fault tolerance. Combining finite-runtime evolutions under $\pm H$ along the loop cancels the leading $O(T^{-1})$ phase error exactly, and Richardson extrapolation further reduces the residual error to an oscillatory term with endpoint-controlled coefficient $O(\|\dot H(0)\|^2Δ(0)^{-4}T^{-2})$. Beyond this deterministic cancellation, we establish that, for suitable smooth runtime distributions, runtime randomization suppresses the remaining oscillatory contribution to $O(T^{-M})$ for any fixed $M$, leading to a randomized Hadamard-test algorithm for Berry phase estimation over the full range $[0,2π)$ with improved runtime scaling under standard sample complexity.

## 143. Quantum-information diagnostics of cosmological perturbations with nontrivial sound speed in inflation
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-23 | **Relevance Score:** 0.176
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Shi-Cheng Liu, Lei-Hua Liu, Bichu Li, Hai-Qing Zhang, Peng-Zhang He

**Abstract:** In this work, we systematically investigate the quantum-information diagnostics of cosmological perturbations with a nontrivial sound speed, utilizing a normalized open two-mode squeezed-state framework. Rather than introducing new observables, our analysis focuses on how a modified sound speed dynamically reshapes the Schrödinger evolution of the squeezing parameters ($r_k$ and $φ_k$). We demonstrate how these dynamical changes are inherited by the reduced density matrix of the observable sector. By employing a sound-speed-resonance parametrization, we derive and evaluate the purity, von Neumann entropy, Rényi entropies, and logarithmic negativity. To overcome the intrinsic multiscale stiffness of the post-inflationary equations, we introduce a bounded variable $x = \tanh r_k$ as a partial regularization, which enables reliable numerical simulations exclusively within the inflationary regime. Our numerical results reveal that a nontrivial sound speed significantly suppresses the purity of the reduced state, indicating enhanced effective mixedness. Simultaneously, it strongly amplifies and modulates both the entropic and entanglement diagnostics. More precisely, a nontrivial sound speed postpones the onset of classicality by modulating the decoherence process. Ultimately, we show that a nontrivial sound speed leaves distinct and identifiable quantum-information signatures within the entanglement structure of the early universe.

**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-22 | **Relevance Score:** 0.176
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Isabel Nha Minh Le, Roeland Wiersema, Christian B. Mendl

**Abstract:** Optimizing tensor networks with standard first-order methods often leads to slow convergence and entrapment in local minima. Although second-order optimization offers enhanced robustness, explicitly constructing the full Hessian matrix is computationally prohibitive for large-scale systems. In this work, we bypass this bottleneck by introducing an analytical Hessian-vector product kernel designed for arbitrary compositions of linear maps. This two-pass algorithm leverages recursive tangent-state propagation with a bounded virtual bond dimension to guarantee scalability. We demonstrate the practical utility of this kernel by integrating it into a Riemannian trust-region framework for quantum circuit compression. Evaluated on time-evolution circuits for various spin chains, our second-order approach achieves up to a four-order-of-magnitude improvement in fidelity over naive Trotterization, while delivering significantly smoother, faster convergence than conventional first-order methods such as Riemannian ADAM.

**Authors:** Erik F. Woering, Richard Hildner

**Abstract:** Optical spectroscopy is an important and widely used technique, for instance, to characterize new materials and to identify unknown compounds. Spectra are typically reported as a function of the wavelength of light, yet the information extracted from such spectra can be misleading. In contrast, spectra represented as a function of the frequency (or photon energy) allow for a more direct extraction of the intrinsic quantum-mechanical properties of the materials under investigation. Here, we discuss this conversion for absorption, fluorescence, and fluorescence excitation spectra. We show step-by-step the different factors that lead to a rescaling of the measured absorption and fluorescence signals.

## 146. Constant Factor Analysis of Optimal Quantum Linear Solvers in Practice

**Authors:** Pedro C. S. Costa, Alexander M. Dalzell, Dong An, Dominic W. Berry

**Abstract:** Optimal quantum linear equation solvers provide complexity $O(κ\log(1/ε))$, where $κ$ is the condition number and $ε$ is the allowable error. The optimal solver using a discrete adiabatic approach [PRX Quantum \textbf{3}, 040303 (2022)] has large analytically proven constant factors for the upper bound on the complexity. The constant factors were later found to be about 1,200 times smaller in numerical testing [Quantum \textbf{9}, 1887 (2025)]. This meant it is about an order of magnitude more efficient than using a randomised approach from [PRX Quantum \textbf{6}, 040373 (2025)], which has far smaller analytically proven constant factors. Recently, a ``Shortcut'' method has been found to provide an optimal solver which also has small proven constant factors. In the present work, we conduct a comprehensive numerical analysis comparing this method with the adiabatic solver for two families of random linear systems. We find that, in the case where the solution norm is \emph{unknown}, the adiabatic solver provides slightly better performance. If the solution norm is \emph{known}, then the shortcut method provides significantly better performance for non-Hermitian matrices.

**Abstract:** We show how to directly and efficiently approximate arbitrary one-qubit unitaries, bypassing the Euler decomposition and the magnitude approximation problem, at the cost of one ancillary qubit. Our technique also applies to approximating unitaries with multi-qubit gate sets such as Clifford and CS, or Clifford and CCZ, as well as to approximating orthogonal matrices using multi-qubit gate sets such as Real Clifford and CCZ. The key tools are repeat-until-success circuits, lattice-based exact synthesis algorithms, integer point enumeration in convex sets, and relative norm equations.

## 148. Signature of paraparticles: a minimal Gedankenexperiment
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-24 | **Relevance Score:** 0.17
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Francesco Toppan

**Abstract:** Paraparticles beyond bosons and fermions can be exchanged via either the braid group (anyons, existing up to $D=2$ space dimensions) or the permutation group; in the latter case the space dimensions are not limited. Besides being predicted, anyons have been experimentally detected. The situation differs for paraparticles exchanged via the permutation group ("permutation-group parastatistics").The first test to detect their theoretical signature was published in 2021 (for $Z_2\times Z_2$-graded parafermions; it was soon followed by a second paper proving the detectability of $Z_2\times Z_2$-graded parabosons). Later on, two further papers proved theoretical signatures of permutation-group parastatistics. These works demonstrate that, in certain situations, a long-held belief on the "conventionality of parastatistics" argument can be evaded: some measurements of permutation-group paraparticles cannot be recovered from ordinary bosons/fermions. The main question now is how to experimentally detect or engineer in the laboratory such paraparticles. For this aim a minimal setup for the theoretical test is here provided: a Gedankenexperiment (a simplified version of the two tests published in 2021) which, essentially, is a flow chart of logical operations. The key point is to present, to experimentalists, the necessary steps to be simulated/realized in the laboratory (possibly, by manipulating qudits). In this minimal setup, the detection/engineering of paraparticles is mapped into a chirality test. The mathematical setting is based on $Z_2\times Z_2$-graded color Lie (super)algebras and derived mathematical structures.

**Abstract:** We demonstrate that combining the positivity of density matrices with steady-state conditions yields a systematic bootstrap method for studying open quantum many-body systems governed by Lindblad master equations on infinite lattices, which exhibit absorbing phase transitions. As a concrete example, we apply this method to the quantum contact process with an absorbing state. We obtain bootstrap bounds on steady-state expectation values, the critical coupling, certain ratios of expectation values in the nontrivial steady state in the supercritical phase, and the Liouvillian spectral gap in the subcritical phase.

**Authors:** Harsh Gupta, Moritz Singer, Benedikt Schoof, Anna Cattani-Scholz, Shreya Sharma, Luca Rommeis, Marc Tornow

**Abstract:** Tantalum is a promising platform for superconducting quantum circuits, yet coherence times remain limited by dielectric losses from interfacial two-level systems (TLS), exacerbated by native oxide regrowth. Here, we implement molecular surface passivation using self-assembled organic monolayers on freshly etched tantalum and silicon in coplanar waveguide resonators. Surface characterization by contact angle, XPS, FTIR and TEM confirm the formation of ordered, nanometer-thick films that suppress oxide formation. Microwave measurements in the ~5-9 GHz range reveal internal quality factors up to 1.8x10^6 in the single-photon regime at 100 mK, representing a ~140% improvement over untreated devices with native oxide. Power and temperature dependent measurements attribute this enhancement to reduced TLS-induced losses. These results demonstrate that molecular passivation effectively engineers low-loss interfaces and provides a scalable route toward high-coherence superconducting quantum devices.

**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Sinchan Ghosh, Manas Kulkarni, K. Sengupta, Satya N. Majumdar

**Abstract:** We show that stochastic resetting may lead to finite entanglement between individual, spatially separated spins (pairwise entanglement) in the steady state of the spin chains driven periodically with frequency $ω_D$. We find the presence of a critical resetting rate $r_c$ below which the steady state pairwise entanglement, measured via concurrence $C$, vanishes. We also identify an optimal resetting rate $r_m$ at which $C$ becomes maximum. These critical and optimal rates exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on $ω_D$. Our analysis demonstrates the existence of special drive frequencies at which $r_c$ vanishes and $r_m$ attains minima. We compute $C$ in the presence of stochastic resetting using exact diagonalization for both the integrable XY model and non-integrable Rydberg spin chains, which demonstrate these features. Our numerical results match perturbative analytical expressions for the special drive frequencies in the large drive amplitude regime.

**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Paul Aigner, Jasmin Matti, Maria Flors Mor-Ruiz, Julius Wallnöfer, Wolfgang Dür

**Abstract:** We develop analytical and algorithmic techniques that enable efficient simulation of a broad class of noisy stabilizer circuits. We derive closed-form expressions of expectation values for tensor product of Paulis in circuits with non-deterministic Pauli measurements, yielding an efficient strong simulation method that avoids explicit density matrix construction and enables direct noise parameter sweeps. We introduce a circuit compression framework that reduces the per-sample cost of weak simulation in general noisy stabilizer circuits, including deterministic measurements, by separating parameter-independent preprocessing from sampling. Finally, we extend the analytical framework beyond its standard domain to include a small number of deterministic measurements, general rotations, and non-diagonal noise channels. Our results provide a unified framework for both strong and weak simulation of noisy stabilizer circuits and corresponds to an extension of the noisy stabilizer formalism introduced in \cite{PhysRevA.107.032424}. They offer applications ranging from calculation of the expectation values of entanglement witnesses, determination of reduced states, to energy evaluation.

## 153. Variance Geometry of Exact Pauli-Detecting Codes: Continuous Landscapes Beyond Stabilizers
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-23 | **Relevance Score:** 0.166
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Arunaday Gupta, Baisong Sun, Xi He, Bei Zeng

**Abstract:** Exact quantum codes detecting a prescribed set of Pauli errors are approached through algebraic constructions--stabilizer, codeword-stabilized, permutation-invariant, topological, and related families. Geometrically, exact Pauli detection is governed by joint higher-rank numerical ranges of these Pauli operators, whose structure for rank $\geq 2$ is largely uncharted. From this viewpoint, we show that such codes often form connected continuous families rather than collections of disjoint solution regions. These families are characterized by a single scalar derived from the Knill-Laflamme conditions: denoted $λ^*$, it is the Euclidean norm of the signature vector of Pauli expectation values on the maximally mixed code state, and provides a one-parameter summary of the code's joint Pauli variance profile. Within these continuous landscapes, stabilizer codes occupy only discrete, measure-zero subsets of the attainable $λ^*$-spectrum, exposing a largely unexplored continuum of genuinely nonadditive exact codes. We establish this picture by analyzing the geometry of higher-rank operator compressions, and extend it to symmetry-restricted settings where cyclic and permutation symmetries are imposed on both the error model and the code projector. Small-system cases reveal interval, singleton, and empty regimes through eigenvalue interlacing and symmetry-sector decompositions; larger systems are treated numerically via Stiefel-manifold optimization and symmetry-adapted parameterizations. In every unrestricted and symmetry-compatible case analyzed, the attainable $λ^*$-spectrum forms a single closed interval whenever nonempty--although a general proof remains open. These results place stabilizer, symmetric, and nonadditive code families within a unified higher-rank variance framework, suggesting a continuous geometric perspective on the landscape of exact quantum codes.

**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-21 | **Relevance Score:** 0.166
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Jianming Wen

**Abstract:** We develop a compact theory of time-reversed Young (TRY) interference beyond the symmetric two-slit geometry by considering equally spaced three-slit, finite $N$-slit, and infinite periodic slit arrays. In the TRY configuration, a point emitter illuminates the aperture, a position-fixed detector records the signal, and the response is reconstructed in source space by correlating the detector record with the source-coordinate label. We show that the three-slit case already reveals the essential new physics beyond two slits: a quadratic Fresnel phase survives, modifies the reconstructed interference law, and lifts the nominal dark fringes in the generic case. For a general equally spaced $N$-slit array, we identify the exact reconstructed response and show that the familiar textbook grating factor is recovered only when the quadratic phase is negligible, compensated, or reduced to a common phase across the array. In that ideal limit, the reconstructed peaks are source-space analogues of classical grating orders rather than outgoing diffraction beams. For an infinite periodic TRY array, we further show that the same discrete quadratic phase generates full and fractional Talbot-like revivals in source space, governed by a reciprocal-distance condition rather than the conventional Talbot propagation law. These results show that the symmetric two-slit TRY geometry is exceptional, while multi-slit TRY systems naturally combine source-space discrimination with sensitivity to aperture-wide phase structure and periodic-array revival physics.

**Authors:** K. Sravan Kumar, João Marto

**Abstract:** In quadratic gravity, with a positive Weyl squared coefficient, the extra spin-2 sector is shown to correspond to a dual inverted harmonic oscillator, instead of a ghost. Using the Wightman spectrum condition, we prove that the associated Källén--Lehmann spectral density vanishes, reflecting the absence of a normalizable ground state and the spacelike nature of the propagator pole. This uniquely fixes the propagator to a principal value form as a theorem, not a prescription. The optical theorem is satisfied, the dual IHO spin-2 is not an asymptotic state, and gives only virtual contributions at all loop orders. As a result, unitarity is preserved consistently with renormalizability.

**Authors:** Suroj Dey, Peter Barker, Animesh Datta

**Abstract:** We show that detecting steady-state Coulomb-mediated reduction in the thermal variance of the differential motional mode of two nanospheres can bound the Continuous Spontaneous Localization (CSL) parameter ($λ_{\text{CSL}}$). For realistic experimental parameters, the resulting bounds are comparable to those obtained from X-ray emission experiments and surpass those set by bulk-heating ones. Unlike these latter experiments, our bounds are robust against plausible coloured-noise extensions of collapse models. In the short-time regime, we find that a weak Coulomb-induced entanglement-based test between two charged nanospheres initialized in ground state can provide constraints on $λ_{\text{CSL}}$ comparable to limits set by early X-ray experiments.

## 157. The clock ambiguity is back with a vengeance

**Authors:** Ovidiu Cristinel Stoica

**Abstract:** Page and Wootters (1983) showed how time and dynamics can emerge in a stationary system containing a clock. Albrecht (1995) later showed, for discrete time, that within this framework any dynamical evolution can be obtained simply by choosing a different clock. Marletto and Vedral (2017) claimed that this ambiguity disappears assuming that the clock and the rest of the world do not interact. I show that their proof relies on an incorrect mathematical assumption. Also, eliminating the ambiguity completely would obstruct spacetime symmetries. Whereas the original clock ambiguity concerns all possible histories of a discrete-time system evolving under arbitrary Hamiltonians, but not the Hamiltonians themselves, I prove a stronger version for continuous and discrete unbounded time: the ambiguity extends to both histories and Hamiltonians, including noninteracting ones. Only the dimension of the Hilbert space remains. One might hope to dismiss the ambiguity as merely perspectival, but I show that this would predict incorrect correlations between outcomes and their records, making even knowledge impossible. Purely relational approaches therefore face both the stronger and the original clock ambiguity problems. The ambiguity is removed by taking into account the physical meaning of the operators.

**Abstract:** The concept of cavity funneling has emerged recently as a promising route towards creating indistinguishable photons from highly dephased emitters. So far, all suggested solutions are solely based on dielectric cavities that require extremely high quality factors that are difficult to reach at visible wavelengths. Here we suggest a hybrid funneling architecture where a dephased emitter is coupled to a plasmonic nanoresonator that is enclosed by an outer dielectric cavity. The estimated lower limit of the outer cavity quality factor is found to be $\sim2$ orders of magnitude lower compared to a cascaded cavity system. Furthermore, the surrounding topology of our approach allows for a partial direct coupling between the emitter and the outer cavity which in turn can increase the overall system extraction efficiency $\left(β\right)$ by a factor of 12, boosting the probability of photon collection.

## 159. Unconventional Quantum Criticality in Long-Range Spin-1 Chains: Insights from Entanglement Entropy and Bipartite Fluctuations
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-22 | **Relevance Score:** 0.155
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Justin Tim-Lok Chau, Jiarui Zhao, Nicolas Laflorencie, Zi Yang Meng

**Abstract:** We study the ground-state phase diagram of a spin-1 Heisenberg chain with staggered long-range (LR) interactions decaying as $\propto r^{-α}$ using a quantum Monte Carlo approach based on the split-spin representation. This formulation enables efficient large-scale simulations by mapping the spin-1 model onto spin-$1/2$ degrees of freedom with local projection constraints. We resolve the continuous quantum phase transition between the gapped Haldane phase at large $α$ (short-range regime) and a gapless antiferromagnetically ordered Néel phase at small $α$ (LR regime), where the continuous SU(2) symmetry is broken. From finite-size scaling and crossing point analyses, we determine the critical point to be at $α_c = 2.48(2)$ and extract the associated critical exponents, which indicate unconventional criticality. In particular, the transition is found to be nonconformal, characterized by a dynamic exponent $z \neq 1$. We further analyze the scaling of entanglement entropy and bipartite fluctuations across the transition, and determine the corresponding universal scalings in both phases and at criticality.

**Authors:** Martti Karvonen

**Abstract:** The main claim of arXiv:2206.08467 is that "functional (deterministic) no-signalling resources can be stronger than probabilistic ones" a certain nonlocal game on a Bell scenario with countably many parties. We disagree and argue that (i) under standard definitions, deterministic no-signalling resources are always probabilistic no-signalling resources; (ii) the deterministic strategy considered in arXiv:2206.08467 can be promoted to a genuinely probabilistic strategy with similar properties and (iii) a key step in the derivation in arXiv:2206.08467, claimed to hold for all no-signalling strategies, implicitly assumes measurability, leaving a gap in the argument. We propose measurability assumptions which we conjecture would make this derivation rigorous. Taken together, the phenomenon highlighted in arXiv:2206.08467 is best understood as a difference between measurable and non-measurable no-signalling resources.

## 161. Constrained Optimal Polynomials for Quantum Linear System Solvers
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-22 | **Relevance Score:** 0.154
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Matthias Deiml, Daniel Peterseim

**Abstract:** Quantum linear system solvers typically realize the inverse map as a polynomial transformation of the spectrum, so their practical cost hinges on implementing this transformation at a low polynomial degree. We introduce constrained optimal polynomials as a framework for this task, drawing on classical Krylov subspace theory. Within this framework, we develop three classes of polynomial solvers. Baseline quantum Chebyshev-type iterations provide general-purpose polynomials based on spectral bounds. Constrained Uniform Polynomial (CUP) solvers optimize the tradeoff between approximation accuracy and block encoding normalization under a uniform spectral model consistent with the available bounds. Constrained Adaptive Polynomial (CAP) solvers retain this structure but replace the uniform model with a probability measure reconstructed from spectral moments via a maximum entropy ansatz, where the moments are extracted from QSVT measurements. Numerical experiments under hardware and stochastic noise show that these methods achieve lower error than standard QSVT-based inversion at a comparable polynomial degree, up to an order of magnitude in noise-limited regimes. CUP offers robust performance under generic spectra, while CAP provides further improvement when the spectral structure can be exploited.

**Authors:** Qirat Iqbal, Altaf Hussain Nizamani

**Abstract:** Magnetic quantum sensors based on trapped ions utilize properties of quantum mechanics which have optimized precision and beat current limits in sensor technology. Trapped ions are highly sensitive in a large span of signal ranging from DC or static B-field to the radiofrequency range in 100s of MHz and can attain the sensitivity in the range of pT to sub pT . They are tuneable to frequencies of interest and can be used as a lock-in frequency detector. This modelling and simulation based study presents an innovative design of Surface Paul Traps, enabling the use of trapped ions as ultra-sensitive sensors for magnetic field detection and precise measurement of magnetic field gradients at a sub-millimeter spatial resolution. The novel design features multiple trapping regions, allowing for the mapping of magnetic fields across various ion-trapping zones. The study demonstrates groundbreaking advancements in ion manipulation and confinement through innovative chip architecture.

**Authors:** Sara Molló-Guri, Oriol Rubies-Bigorda, Raphael Holzinger, Jonah S. Peter, Susanne F. Yelin

**Abstract:** We investigate how laser-driven, cooperative dipole-dipole interactions in weakly trapped atomic arrays give rise to self-organized configurations. Starting from an analytically tractable two-emitter system, we identify the possible steady-state spatial arrangements accessible to the atoms. We then extend this analysis to larger ensembles in both linear and ring geometries. In linear chains, we demonstrate the emergence of topologically nontrivial dimerized configurations across a range of initial interatomic spacings. In ring geometries, we find that the system undergoes self-organized contraction and expansion, enabling access to length scales below those set by the trapping lattice. Our results demonstrate that collective light-matter interactions in free space can spontaneously generate modified ordered geometries, even when the emitters are initially separated by distances larger than their transition wavelength.

## 164. Qubit Routing for (Almost) Free
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-21 | **Relevance Score:** 0.148
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Arianne Meijer-van de Griend

**Abstract:** In this paper, we give a mathematical proof that bounds the number of CNOT gates required to synthesize an $n$ qubit phase polynomial with $g$ terms to be at least $O(\frac{gn}{\max (\log g, 1)})$ and at most $O(gn)$. However, when targeting restricted hardware, not all CNOTs are allowed. If we were to use SWAP-based methods to route the qubits on the architecture such that the earlier synthesized gates are natively allowed, we increase the number of CNOTs by a routing overhead factor of $O(\log n) \leq α\leq O(n \log^2 n)$. However, if we only synthesize allowed gates, we do not need to route any qubits. Moreover, in that case the routing overhead factor is $1 \leq α\leq 4 \simeq O(1)$. Additionally, since phase polynomials and Hadamard gates together form a universal gate set, we get qubit routing for almost free.

**Abstract:** We quantize a classically stable system of a harmonic oscillator polynomially coupled to a ghost with negative kinetic energy. We prove that due to an integral of motion with a positive discrete spectrum: i) the Hamiltonian has a pure point spectrum unbounded in both directions, ii) the evolution is manifestly unitary, iii) the vacuum is well-defined, iv) expectation values for squares of canonical variables are bounded. Numerical solutions of the Schrödinger equation confirm these results. We argue that the discrete spectrum of the integral of motion enforces stability for extended interactions.

## 166. The Exact Replica Threshold for Nonlinear Moments of Quantum States
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-24 | **Relevance Score:** 0.146
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Shuai Zeng

**Abstract:** Joint measurements on multiple copies of a quantum state provide access to nonlinear observables such as $\operatorname{tr}(ρ^t)$, but whether replica number marks a sharp information-theoretic resource boundary has remained unclear. For every fixed order $t\ge 3$, existing protocols show that $\lceil t/2\rceil$ replicas already suffice for polynomial-sample estimation of $\operatorname{tr}(ρ^t)$, yet it has remained open whether one fewer replica must necessarily incur a sample-complexity barrier growing with the dimension. We prove that this is indeed the case in the sample/copy-access model with replica-limited joint measurements: any protocol restricted to $\lceil t/2\rceil-1$ replicas requires dimension-growing sample complexity, while $\lceil t/2\rceil$ replicas suffice by prior work. Thus the exact replica threshold for fixed-order pure moments is $\lceil t/2\rceil$. Equivalently, for fixed-order pure moments, one additional coherent replica is not merely useful but marks the exact threshold between polynomial-sample estimation and a dimension-growing regime in the replica-limited model. We further show that the same threshold law extends to a broad family of observable-weighted moments $\operatorname{tr}(Oρ^t)$, including Pauli observables and other observables with bounded operator norm and macroscopic trace norm. Coherent replica number therefore acts as a genuinely discrete resource for nonlinear quantum-state estimation.

**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Ángel L. Corps, Armando Relaño, Angelo Russomanno

**Abstract:** We study an Ising model with long-range interactions undergoing a time-periodic kicking. For different initial states we observe persistent period doubling. When there is period doubling we find that the initial state has relevant overlap with Floquet states showing time-translation symmetry breaking, organized in doublets displaying $π$-spectral pairing (as highlighted by the $π$-spectral gap) and long-range order (as shown by the eigenvalues of the magnetization in the doublet). We observe period doubling for initial states with domain walls and tilted spins, and for the latter ones a finite-size scaling of the relevant $π$-shifted gap and magnetization eigenvalues suggests period-doubling oscillations persisting for larger system sizes and lasting a time exponential in the system size. We find that just a minority of Floquet states displays time-translation symmetry breaking while the rest is thermal, a weak-ergodicity breaking situation typical of systems with quantum scars. Although the time-translation symmetry breaking eigenstates are the minority, their number is exponential in the system size and this motivates the period doubling observed for many different initial states.

**Authors:** Alexander D. Popov

**Abstract:** We consider two-dimensional harmonic oscillator in the complex Bargmann-Fock-Segal representation with $T^*{\mathbb R}^{2}={\mathbb C}^2$ as classical phase space. We show that the eigenfunctions $ψ_n$ of the quantum Hamiltonian correspond to complex radial coordinates in the reduced phase space ${\mathbb C}^2/{\mathbb Z}_n\subset{\mathbb C}^2$. They describe ${\mathbb Z}_n$-invariant motion of particle along a circle $S^1$ in lens space $S^3/{\mathbb Z}_n\subset{\mathbb C}^2/{\mathbb Z}_n$, where ${\mathbb Z}_n$ is the cyclic group of rotation by an angle $2π/n$ on the circle $S^1$, $n=1,2,...\,$. Thus the general solution of the Schrödinger equation carries information about an infinite number of admissible classical states $ψ_n$ that can be mapped to other states after lifting into the quantum bundle. We show that in the Kepler/hydrogen atom problem there is a similar correspondence between classical and quantum states.

## 169. Why Does Classical Turbulence Obey an Area Law?
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-21 | **Relevance Score:** 0.144
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Wael Itani

**Abstract:** In incompressible flow the viscous force is solenoidal, whereas the Madelung transform of a spinless Schrödinger equation produces only gradient forces. The two are orthogonal, so viscosity cannot arise from Hamiltonian quantum mechanics alone; an open quantum treatment is required. Reducing the $N$-body density matrix to its one-body component and closing the dynamics via Born-Markov yields Lindblad jump operators with $k^2$ scattering rates, which we unravel via quantum state diffusion (QSD) into a norm-preserving stochastic nonlinear Schrödinger equation. Dissipation and stochastic forcing are not separate ingredients: both come from the same Lindblad operators, and their amplitudes are locked by the QSD structure. The Madelung transform of this equation, under incompressibility, gives a stochastic Navier-Stokes equation whose viscosity is set by the mean free path and whose noise correlator satisfies the fluctuation-dissipation relation by construction, in agreement with the Landau-Lifshitz framework. The recovery is conditional: the viscous identification holds at the ensemble level via the vortex decomposition of the velocity field; the single-trajectory identification remains open. The zeros of the wavefunction carry quantised circulation; their codimension-2 topology yields the Migdal area law for circulation statistics under a Poisson assumption, here through a different mechanism than the loop-functional saddle point and verified numerically even in the quantum regime where the de~Broglie length exceeds the Kolmogorov scale.

**Authors:** Masaya Kunimi, Takafumi Tomita

**Abstract:** We study the magnetic-field dependence of the interactions between two alkaline-earth(-like) Rydberg atoms, ${}^{88}$Sr and ${}^{174}$Yb. Considering the pair of Rydberg states $|ns,{}^3S_1,m_J\rangle$ and $|(n+1)s,{}^3S_1,m_J\rangle$, we show that the effective Hamiltonian takes the form of an {\it XXZ}-type quantum spin model, as in the alkali-atom case [M. Kunimi and T. Tomita, Phys. Rev. A {\bf 112}, L051301 (2025)]. We find that the behavior of the anisotropy parameter for ${}^{174}$Yb at zero magnetic field is significantly different from that for other atomic species. This behavior originates from the strong spin-orbit coupling in ${}^{174}$Yb. We systematically calculate the interaction parameters of the {\it XXZ} model in the presence of a magnetic field and show that they can be tuned by the field. As applications to quantum many-body problems, we investigate one-dimensional systems in the large-anisotropy regime and show that the folded {\it XXZ} model can be realized in ${}^{174}$Yb systems without fine-tuning of the field. We also investigate two-dimensional square-lattice systems and show that a supersolid phase can emerge in the ground state at the mean-field level.

**Abstract:** We investigate the topology of the different phases of the extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (eSSH) model, which includes hopping processes between translationally inequivalent atoms beyond nearest neighbors. Exact analytical expressions for the edge states of a semi-infinite eSSH chain are derived, with wave functions that decay exponentially from the boundary with a unit-cell decay factor z. From the winding number of the bulk Hamiltonian under periodic boundary conditions, we determine the topological phase diagram and establish the bulk-boundary correspondence: changes in the winding number coincide with bulk gap closings and with the condition |z|=1 for the edge-state solutions. For finite chains, we further obtain analytical, approximate expressions for the low-energy edge states, which are shown to be highly accurate.

**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Xin Zhou, Francesco Massel

**Abstract:** In our work, we show how, for a network of bosonic modes, canonical commutation relations constrain the coefficients relating input and internal modes. Based on these constraints, we derive a lower bound on the total steady-state squeezing achievable in reservoir-engineered (dissipative) squeezing schemes, quantified by the sum of mode-optimal quadrature variances normalized to its corresponding input variance. The bound follows solely from canonical commutation relations and stability, and is saturated in the strong-coupling limit at 1. Furthermore, we show that adding independent parametric driving terms for each mode changes the quantum noise-gain balance and yields a distinct optimum bound, approaching 1/2. In addition, we show how these constraints allow us to reformulate the Duan inseparability criterion for a three-mode bosonic system in terms of a single parameter-dependent figure of merit. Our results apply directly to current electromechanical and nanomechanical experiments and indicate that the two-mode bounds can be experimentally approached even at room temperature.

**Authors:** Tristan Zaborniak, Prashanti Priya Angara, Vikram Khipple Mulligan, Hausi Müller, Ulrike Stege

**Abstract:** We introduce a qubit- and gate-efficient higher-order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO) encoding for graph partitioning problems requiring label-count minimization. This widely applicable class of problems includes minimum graph coloring, minimum $k$-cut, and community detection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to address the optimization versions of these problems in a quantum setting, rather than only their decision counterparts. Our construction encodes each $k$-valued vertex variable using $\lceil \log_2 k \rceil$ bits and employs a novel lexicographic penalty system that implicitly minimizes partition count without requiring dedicated indicator variables. We derive provably sufficient conditions on all penalty coefficients, including those arising from Rosenberg quadratization, guaranteeing feasibility and optimality of the lowest-energy solution. Analogous conditions are derived for a one-hot encoding to enable controlled comparison. We also show that our encoding reduces two-qubit gate count per QAOA layer from $Θ(|V||k|^2 + |E||k|)$ for the one-hot encoding to $Θ(|E| \cdot |k| \lceil\log_2 |k|\rceil)$. Benchmarking on a quantum annealer demonstrates that our logarithmic encoding significantly improves solution quality and time-to-solution for minimum graph coloring relative to one-hot encoding, with greater advantage as problem size increases.

**Authors:** Kritika Rushiya, Gaurav Hajong, Bhabani Prasad Mandal, Poonam Mehta

**Abstract:** We develop a consistent mathematical framework for studying two flavor neutrino oscillations in presence of non-Hermitian dynamics. We consider two approaches : (a) bi-orthonormal inner product defined by a positive-definite metric operator $\mathcal{G}$ and (b) the density matrix prescription by Brody and Graefe [Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 230405 (2012)]. For the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric case, we show that the $\mathcal{G}$ metric approach does not work well (probabilities are not conserved) both in $\mathcal{PT}$-unbroken as well as $\mathcal{PT}$-broken regime. Hence, we adopt the density matrix prescription by Brody and Graefe which is a positive semi-definite map. In the density matrix prescription, we note that probability in the steady state limit is not necessarily $1/2$ thereby indicating non-Markovian behavior.

**Abstract:** We construct a quantum low-density parity-check code family from a length-$512$ Calderbank--Shor--Steane base matrix pair. The base pair is permutation-equivalent to the known SPC(3) product CSS code, and the present affine-coset description gives a direct proof that both Tanner graphs are $(3,8)$-regular with girth $8$. The base code has parameters $[[512,174,8]]$. We then apply circulant permutation matrix (CPM) lifts. The main decoding experiment uses the CPM-lifted code with lift factor $P=32$, which has parameters $[[16384,4142,\le 40]]$, under the code-capacity depolarizing model. A belief-propagation decoder with post-processing achieved frame error rate about $10^{-8}$ at $p=0.085$, and one observed logical residual of weight $40$ gives a decoder-derived upper bound $d\le 40$.

**Authors:** Shuntaro Yamamoto, Nobuyuki Yoshioka

**Abstract:** We present pygridsynth, an open-source Python library for ancilla-free approximate Clifford+$T$ synthesis that runs in $O(\log(1/ε))$ for precision $ε$. For $n=1, 2$ qubits, the library builds upon established efficient and high-precision synthesis routines, such as nearly optimal $Z$-rotation synthesis and magnitude approximation. For $n\ge 3$ qubits, we introduce a partial-decomposition technique that generalizes the magnitude approximation, reducing constant factors in the $T$-count as $(\frac{21}{8}\cdot 4^n - \frac{9}{2}\cdot 2^n + 9)\log_2(1/ε) + o(\log(1/ε))$. The package also exposes a mixed-synthesis workflow that approximates target unitary channels by probabilistic mixtures of Clifford+$T$ circuits, for which we empirically find that the synthesis error is reduced from $ε$ to $ε^2/(2n)$. Taken together, these features make pygridsynth a Python-native platform for high-precision Clifford$+T$ synthesis and for benchmarking unitary and mixed synthesis strategies on multi-qubit instances.

**Authors:** Dikran S Meliksetian

**Abstract:** We introduce and empirically validate Landscape Span Compression (LSC), a device-agnostic metric for quantifying how hardware noise distorts the variational energy landscape of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). Intuitively, LSC measures how much noise flattens the energy landscape, approaching 1 as the landscape collapses toward a barren plateau. We report an experience study of applying QAOA with LSC-based noise characterization on IBM's ibm_fez for three constrained QUBO portfolio instances, distilling practical lessons for parameter transfer, calibration-model fidelity, and error mitigation. Running p=1 QAOA on ibm_fez (Heron r2, 156 qubits) with up to 57,344 shots per grid point across three constrained binary optimization instances encoded as QUBO problems, we find: (i) hardware noise uniformly compresses the landscape span by 24-30% without displacing the global minimum, supporting classical-to-hardware parameter transfer; (ii) feasibility fractions at the optimal parameters remain 1.5-1.7 times above random sampling despite noise-induced degradation; (iii) the IBM calibration-based noise model achieves Pearson r=0.959 structural agreement with hardware but explains only approximately 42% of approximation-ratio degradation, with crosstalk and coherent errors as the leading unexplained contributors; (iv) a consistent noise cost of approximately 0.03 approximation-ratio units is observed across all instances; and (v) Zero-Noise Extrapolation yields mixed energy improvements of +7%/+9%/-4% per instance with 3-5 times uncertainty inflation. We compare LSC against four existing metrics and argue it is the most robust discriminator of noise severity for constrained QAOA on near-term devices.

**Authors:** Zhenming Zhang, Tianyu Li, Wei Yi

**Abstract:** We propose a unified framework, dubbed topological word, for the complete non-Abelian bulk-boundary correspondence in multigap non-Abelian topological insulators. Composed by an ordered sequence of letters, each a non-Abelian charge depicting the gap-resolved topology, the topological word captures both the global non-Abelian topology corresponding to the homotopy classification, and the band-adjacency information. The latter, though crucial for the edge-state pattern across multiple gaps, is often overlooked in previous studies. We confirm our framework using both static models and periodically driven Floquet systems, and discuss its connection and distinction with existing descriptions, such as the phase-band singularities and braiding representations. Intriguingly, topological word continues to provide insight regarding topology and edge states, even as the global non-Abelian topology becomes ill-defined under broken parity-time symmetry.

**Authors:** Matthias Diez, Johannes K. Krondorfer, Albert Hirtenfelder, Andreas W. Hauser

**Abstract:** Among the possible types of magnetic dipole interactions in molecular systems, couplings between nuclear motion and the nuclear spin have probably received the least attention in molecular spectroscopy. Although very small in comparison to effects related to electron spin, this type of hyperfine interaction plays an important role in the NMR spectroscopy of molecular systems. While measurement and prediction of spin-rotation tensors are a common place, vibrationally induced effects still lack a comprehensive description. In this article we develop a generic, theoretical framework that is well embedded in modern electronic structure theory and inspired by the Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian for electronic interactions, distinguishing between nuclear spin-orbit and spin-other-orbit contributions. We show that the interaction of nuclear spins with pseudorotational excitations of highly symmetric molecules may lead to experimentally accessible hyperfine splittings in NMR spectra, triggered by infrared light.

**Authors:** Ali Can Günhan, Onur Pusuluk, Thomas Oikonomou, G. Baris Bagci

**Abstract:** The generalized second laws of quantum thermodynamics are usually formulated in terms of Rényi divergences and the associated family of generalized free energies. In catalytic thermal transformations, this framework typically certifies the existence of a suitable catalyst but does not make the catalytic contribution explicit in the resulting system-level inequalities. Here we develop a complementary formulation based on non-additive divergences, whose pseudo-additive structure yields a family of generalized free energies with an explicit catalyst-dependent correction term. For uncorrelated catalytic thermal transformations, we show that this leads to non-additive second-law relations that make the catalytic contribution explicit and provide nontrivial constraints on admissible catalysts when the catalyst is returned only approximately. We also analyze correlated catalytic thermal transformations and show, through explicit finite-dimensional examples, that reduced-state data are generally insufficient to characterize thermodynamic accessibility: the thermo-majorization behavior of the joint transformation can change while the system and catalyst marginals remain fixed, and even states with identical marginals and the same mutual information can exhibit different thermo-majorization accessibility. Our results show that non-additivity can be thermodynamically informative in uncorrelated catalysis, whereas correlated catalysis generally requires a genuinely joint-state-sensitive description beyond reduced-state monotones.

## 181. Vertical Shuttling Protocols for Trapped Ions in Multi-Rail, Multi-Zone Surface Ion Trap Architectures
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-23 | **Relevance Score:** 0.119
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Qirat Iqbal, Altaf H. Nizamani

**Abstract:** We investigate optimized vertical ion-shuttling protocols for trapped-ion applications across a range of ion-trap experiments, including three-dimensional gradient-measurement sensors, on-chip ion fluorescence collection and imaging, improved laser accessibility, and quantum information processing. In this work, we focus on minimizing motional energy gain during ion transport. Our findings indicate that anomalous heating becomes the dominant limiting factor only for shuttling durations exceeding $500~μ\mathrm{s}$, whereas the final motional excitation is strongly dependent on the selected transport protocol. Using a recently measured heating rate of $(3.1 \pm 0.35)$ quanta/ms at an ion--surface separation of $134 \pm 1.5~μ\mathrm{m}$, we demonstrate that the motional excitation can be restricted to fewer than eight quanta when the ion is vertically displaced by $86~μ\mathrm{m}$ from its initial position. These results enable adiabatic shuttling within $0.5~\mathrm{ms}$, thereby meeting the operational requirements for high-fidelity quantum sensing and coherent control.

**Authors:** Jonatan A. Posligua, David E. Stewart, Denis R. Candido

**Abstract:** Solid-state spin defects hold great promise as building blocks for various quantum technologies. Embedding spin centers in $p$-$n$ diodes under reverse bias has proved to be a powerful strategy to narrow the optical linewidth and increase spin coherence, while also enabling control of the photoluminescence wavelength via Stark shift. Given the multitude of parameters influencing spin centers in diodes (e.g., doping densities and profiles, temperature, bias voltage, spin center position), a question that has not yet been answered is: which set of these design parameters maximizes spin center coherence? In this work, we address this question by developing a scaled gradient descent optimization algorithm that minimizes the optical linewidth of spin centers by combining the numerical solution of a diode's Poisson equation with calculated charge noise from the non-depleted regions. Our optimization is performed for both single- and multiple-parameter cases for divacancies in SiC $p$-$i$-$n$ diodes, including reverse-bias voltage, doping density and profile, and diode total length. Importantly, the optimization is subject to realistic physical constraints, such as small operating bias voltages, avoidance of the dielectric breakdown regime and physical thresholds for doping density. Additionally, due to the leakage current at reverse bias voltages, we develop a new formalism to investigate its influence on coherence. We show that the corresponding noise can be mitigated by implanting spin defects away from the diode's surfaces. Our work provides guidance on experimentally relevant diodes for hosting spin centers with the narrowest optical linewidths and longest coherence times.

## 183. Toward nanophotonic platforms for solid-state $^{229}$Th nuclear clocks

Düllmann, Christoph Marquardt, Ulrich Wahl, Bart Kuyken, Thorsten Schumm, Pascal Del'Haye, Lino M. C. Pereira, Georgy A. Kazakov, Kasper Van Gasse, Charles Roques-Carmes

**Abstract:** While the $^{229}$Th nuclear isomer has recently been observed and laser-excited, converting optical nuclear manipulation into a chip-scale solid-state frequency standard remains an open challenge. Here, we present a nanophotonic platform to realize an all-solid-state nuclear clock based on the low-energy isomeric transition of $^{229}$Th embedded in high-$Q$ fluoride photonic resonators. By coupling ensembles of thorium nuclei to confined optical modes, we show that resonant field build-up in the cavity can substantially enhance the nuclear excitation rate, enabling optical interrogation at practical laser intensities. We model the nuclei-photon interaction dynamics and outline a technological roadmap toward addressing this challenge, including resonator fabrication in fluoride crystals, thorium implantation, nuclear excitation with integrated lasers, and on-chip detection of vacuum-ultraviolet photons. As an initial proof of concept, we implant a crystalline fluoride whispering-gallery-mode resonator with $^{229}$Th and assess the impact of implantation-induced damage on resonator performance. Our platform leverages recent advances in materials integration and nanophotonics to chart a realistic route toward compact and scalable nuclear frequency standards.

**Abstract:** We investigate the effects of finite-range interatomic interactions on the equation of state (EoS) of a weakly interacting Bose gas. Within the Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis effective action approach, we show that finite-range effects influence not only the EoS but also the thermodynamic properties of the system at zero temperature, leading to nonuniversal behavior.

**Authors:** Khalid N. Anindya, Hong Guo

**Abstract:** A single organic spin platform hosts both dimerized $S=\tfrac{1}{2}$ and effective Haldane $S=1$ sectors, linked by bond-texture inversion. At the junction, the fractional mode is controlled by termination parity: quenched by local fusion at one termination and released as an uncompensated spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$-like degree of freedom at the parity-shifted one. Two such internal boundary modes of a finite embedded Haldane domain hybridize with an exponentially decaying splitting, establishing termination parity as a design principle for engineering and coupling fractional boundary modes.

## 186. Rank-2 Electromagnetic Backgrounds and Angular Momentum Barriers in Gravitomagnetic Spin-Quadrupole Searches
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-22 | **Relevance Score:** 0.104
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Leonardo A. Pachon

**Abstract:** We present a complete analysis of the angular momentum selection rules and electromagnetic backgrounds that constrain any spectroscopic search for the gravitomagnetic spin-quadrupole coupling in highly charged ions. A sequence of four barriers is identified: (i)~the Wigner-Eckart theorem mandates $j \geq 3/2$ electronic states for sensitivity to the rank-2 gravitomagnetic operator, excluding the deformation-immune $j=1/2$ states; (ii)~the nuclear electric quadrupole hyperfine interaction (HFS-E2) generates an $\sim 18$-orders-of-magnitude electromagnetic background in the required $j=3/2$ channel; (iii)~second-order HFS mixing between fine-structure levels leaves a residual $\sim 10^{-6}$ eV even after centroid extraction; (iv)~tensor nuclear polarizability (TNP), scaling with $B(E2)$ rather than $Q_s$, introduces an independent rank-2 background of $\sim 10^{-12}$ eV. We derive the algebraic conditions under which a multi-isotope, multi-transition Generalized King Plot can separate these backgrounds from the gravitational signal, and show that the minimum experimental topology requires three transitions and $N_{\text{odd}} \geq N_{\text{bkg}} + 1$ odd-spin isotopes with linearly independent nuclear parameters. For the molybdenum chain, this yields a first laboratory-derivable bound $|χ- 1| \lesssim 10^{8} - 10^9$ on the gyrogravitational ratio, limited by current precision on nuclear quadrupole moments and transition rates. We quantify the experimental milestones needed to improve this bound by each order of magnitude, providing a roadmap for future searches.

## 187. Subsystem-Resolved Spectral Theory for Quantum Many-Body Hamiltonians
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-23 | **Relevance Score:** 0.103
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** MD Nahidul Hasan Sabit

**Abstract:** We study spectral properties of quantum many-body Hamiltonians through a subsystem-based framework. Given a Hamiltonian of the form $H = \sum_{X \subseteq Λ} Φ(X)$ acting on a tensor product Hilbert space, we associate to each subset $S \subseteq Λ$ a subsystem Hamiltonian $H_S$ and its spectrum $\mathcal{S}(S) = σ(H_S)$. This produces a family of spectra indexed by subsystems, allowing spectral data to be organized according to interaction structure. We show that subsystem Hamiltonians admit local approximations: $H_S$ can be approximated by operators supported on finite neighborhoods with an error bounded by $\|H_S - H_{S,r}\| \le |S| e^{-μr} \|Φ\|_μ$. As a consequence, subsystem spectra are stable under truncation in the sense that $d_H(\mathcal{S}(S), σ(H_{S,r})) \le |S| e^{-μr} \|Φ\|_μ.$ We then prove that for disjoint subsets $S_1, S_2 \subseteq Λ$, the subsystem spectrum is approximately additive: $d_H\big(\mathcal{S}(S_1 \cup S_2), \mathcal{S}(S_1) + \mathcal{S}(S_2)\big) \le (|S_1| + |S_2|) e^{-μD} \|Φ\|_μ,$ where $D = d(S_1, S_2)$. In the finite-range case, this relation becomes exact. The results show that spectral properties reflect the locality of interactions not only at the level of operators, but also at the level of spectra. The framework provides a way to study many-body systems in which interaction geometry directly shapes spectral behavior.

**Authors:** Hasna Chnafa, Clarence Cortes, David Laroze, Ahmed Jellal

**Abstract:** Electron transport in graphene under a laser-modulated barrier is studied in the presence of an energy gap, a scalar potential, and a uniaxial zigzag strain. The transfer-matrix approach is used with the boundary conditions to derive the transmission probabilities as functions of different system parameters. Without strain, raising either the energy gap or the potential generally reduces transmission in the central and lower sidebands. Moderate zigzag strain generates pronounced Fano-type oscillations that vanish at large strain, while transmission increases for low potential and decreases for high values. In the upper sideband, the incidence energy shifts the resonance peaks to the right, and growing the barrier width generates characteristic oscillatory patterns. Furthermore, increasing the laser field amplitude enhances transmission, whereas higher laser frequencies tend to suppress it. These findings offer new perspectives on controlling electronic transport in gapped graphene via external fields, strain, and potential applications in optoelectronic devices.

**Authors:** Anirban N. Chowdhury, Samuel O. Scalet, Kunal Sharma

**Abstract:** Stationary states of quantum many-body Hamiltonians are invariant under the Hamiltonian evolution. Besides ground and thermal states, this class includes microcanonical ensembles that are of fundamental importance in statistical physics. We consider the preparation of general stationary states by leveraging recent advances in the field of open-system dynamics. In particular, constructions based on exact KMS-detailed balance with respect to Gibbs states of noncommuting Hamiltonians have only recently been proposed as a tool for their efficient preparation and, by extension to small temperatures, for ground state preparation. We extend these constructions to the problem of stationary state preparation, providing general criteria that characterize when such states have efficient implementations, along with specific results on the approximation of microcanonical ensembles. An interesting application of our work are tests of conjectured ensemble equivalences for local observables between microcanonical and Gibbs ensembles.

## 190. Impact of Photoelectric Readout Noise on Magnetic Field Sensitivity of NV Centers in Diamond

**Authors:** Ilia Chuprina, Genko Genov, Christoph Findler, Johannes Lang, Petr Siyushev, Fedor Jelezko

**Abstract:** Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are of great interest for nano- and macro-scale magnetic field sensing. Most sensing protocols rely on conventional optical readout, which is limited by photon shot noise. The recently developed photoelectrical (PE) readout of the NV center electron spin state promises to overcome these limitations. However, the noise of the PE readout and its influence on readout efficiency have not been thoroughly studied. In this work, we perform magnetic field sensing and estimate the sensitivity using optical and PE readout with a single and an ensemble of NV centers in diamond. We investigate the electronic noise associated with the photoelectric detection and estimate the readout efficiency, using Gaussian statistics. Our quantitative analysis shows that the Johnson-Nyquist noise-limited photoelectric magnetic field sensitivity could outperform optical measurements by an order of magnitude. This work is an essential step towards the development of on-chip magnetometers using photoelectrical detection in diamond.

**Abstract:** In many chemical reactions, short-lived radical intermediates play a crucial role, while detecting such short-lived species in-situ remains challenging. The optically readable electronic spin of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond is a nanoscale sensor for such radical species: its longitudinal spin relaxation time (T$_{1}$) reacts to magnetic fluctuations from the unpaired electrons of radical species in its local environment. In this setting, we demonstrate the successful in-situ detection of the nitroxide radical 2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl (TEMPO) using NV center-based T$_1$ relaxometry after depositing nanodiamonds onto the inner wall of a glass cuvette. A significant concentration-dependent shortening of the relaxation time was observed, from $197\:μs \pm 21\:μs$ without radical to $66\:μs \pm 30\:μs$ at a concentration of 1 M TEMPO. The detection is sensitive in the nanomolar (nM) range and the determined signal-to-noise ratio is between 1.6 and 3.

**Abstract:** We present an analysis of model for the motion of massive “Littlewood's” hopping hoop. It includes the analytic conditions required for the hoop to hop and for the normal reaction force not to vanish throughout the motion, discusses the contradictory phenomenon called “quasi-jump,” and suggest that “skimming” motion is impossible in corresponding model. We find that the hoop may either hop at the first instant of release, or not at all.

**Abstract:** We investigate the effect of a periodic electric field drive on the generalized Aubry-André model, also known as the Ganeshan-Pixley-Das Sarma (GPD) model, which is well known as a host of mobility edges. Our study of the Floquet spectrum of the driven GPD model uncovers the emergence of two distinct Floquet mobility edges, a delocalized--localized (DL) edge in the bounded regime, and a multifractal--localized (ML) edge in the unbounded regime. Using analytical results derived from Avila's global theory applied to the high frequency effective Hamiltonian, together with numerical diagnostics such as the fractal dimension and inverse participation ratio, we demonstrate that these mobility edges can be effectively controlled by the amplitude and frequency of the electric field drive. We also identify drive-induced localization at specific values of the driving parameters, corresponding to dynamical localization points in the absence of quasiperiodic potential. Furthermore, the dynamical study of the periodically driven GPD model demonstrates superdiffusive to almost ballistic transport in the bounded regime corresponding to the DL edges, whereas subdiffusive transport is observed in the unbounded regime associated with the ML edges. We also analyze deviations from the high-frequency effective description by explicitly examining the low-frequency driving regime, where significant and counterintuitive deviations in both spectral properties and transport behavior are observed. Our study highlights the interplay of a quasiperiodic potential and a periodically varying electric field drive as a powerful mechanism to engineer mobility edges and control transport in systems with rich spectral features.

**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-21 | **Relevance Score:** 0.052

**Authors:** Nazım Sertkan, İzzet Sakallı

**Abstract:** We study charged massive scalar field perturbations on the rotating black hole (BH) background of Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion (EMDA) theory, known as the Kerr-EMDA BH. Starting from the gauge-covariant Klein-Gordon equation (KGE), we perform a full separation of variables and obtain exact analytical solutions for both the angular and radial parts in terms of confluent Heun functions (CHFs). Unlike the earlier neutral scalar treatment by Senjaya and Ponglertsakul [Eur. Phys. J. C \textbf{85}, 352 (2025)], the electromagnetic coupling $q$ fundamentally alters the structure of the Heun parameters and produces qualitatively new physics. Applying the CHF polynomial condition, we derive the resonant frequency spectrum whose imaginary parts are equispaced with $|Δω_I| = 1/(2M)$, a universal spacing determined solely by the BH mass. Via the Maggiore prescription and the first law of BH thermodynamics, this yields a parameter-dependent entropy quantum $δS_{\text{BH}} = 4πr_+/(r_+ - r_-)$, which reduces to $4π$ for Schwarzschild but diverges at extremality -- {\color{black}in contrast to the universal $2π$ obtained for the rotating linear dilaton BH (RLDBH).} We construct the effective potential governing scalar wave scattering and analyze its dependence on the dilaton parameter $D$, rotation $a$, and scalar charge $q$. In the massless uncharged limit, the CHF reduces to the Gauss hypergeometric function, {\color{black}enabling us to compute the first analytical greybody factor (GF) for the Kerr-EMDA geometry; we show that this reduction extends to massless charged scalars, yielding a closed-form GF that captures superradiant amplification.} We examine how the dilaton deformation distinguishes the Kerr-EMDA spectrum from the standard Kerr and Kerr-Newman cases.

**Authors:** Maxence Lepers, G. Hovhannesyan, Y. Guyot, R. Moncorgé, M. Velazquez

**Abstract:** We show in this article the improvements which can be obtained in the description of the luminescence properties of Pr3+ doped materials by using an extension of the Judd-Ofelt theory in order to relax some strong selection rules and approximations of the standard formalism and to better account for the influence of the 4f5d excited electronic configuration. The demonstration is made by re-examining the case of Pr3+:YAG, a well known luminescent and laser crystal with a very low energy 4f5d absorption band. Our extension thus provides a better agreement between calculated and measured absorption intensities, especially for the hypersensitive 3 H4 $\rightarrow$ 3 P2 transition. A comparison is made with the results obtained in the case of Pr3+:ZBLAN, a laser fluoride glass with much higher 4f5d absorption levels. Our investigation also gives the opportunity, in the case of Pr3+:YAG, to provide more complete and more reliable absorption and emission data than reported in the past literature and to exploit these data to better address the question of laser operation at various emission wavelengths. It is thus demonstrated that laser operation should be possible with improved laser performance at 488 nm, 616 nm and 744 nm, as it was already achieved in the past, but also at 566 nm and 931 nm by using appropriate laser cavities and laser mirrors.

**Abstract:** We study black-hole quasinormal modes by applying the complex scaling method (CSM) to the perturbation equations of Schwarzschild and Reissner--Nordström black holes. The method converts the outgoing-wave boundary condition into a non-Hermitian eigenvalue problem, allowing quasinormal-mode frequencies to be computed within a common spectral framework. We first benchmark the method for the Schwarzschild Regge--Wheeler equation and then extend it to the Reissner--Nordström family, including the extremal limit. Our results show that CSM provides a unified and flexible approach to the computation of black-hole quasinormal frequencies.

**Authors:** Zhengyu Li, Curtis Bright, Stefan Trandafir, Adán Cabello, Vijay Ganesh

**Abstract:** We present a search for small Kochen-Specker (KS) sets in dimension 3, specifically targeting extensions of the 13-ray Yu-Oh set, which has been proven to be the minimal witness to state-independent contextuality. To enable this search, we introduce a novel SAT-based orderly generation framework integrating recursive canonical labeling (RCL) with the graph isomorphism tool NAUTY. We demonstrate that previous SAT approaches relying on lexicographical canonicity suffer from exponential scaling on canonical graphs. This limitation renders them intractable on the large instances (25 to 33 vertices) encountered in our search, whereas our RCL check maintains consistent millisecond-level performance, effectively eliminating the bottleneck. Overcoming this bottleneck allows us to perform the first exhaustive enumeration of all KS sets with up to 33 rays containing the complete 25-ray state-independent contextuality (SI-C) set obtained by rigid extensions of the Yu-Oh set in 1,641 CPU hours. We found and verified that the 33-ray set discovered by Schütte is the smallest three-dimensional KS set containing the complete 25-ray SI-C set. All non-existence results are backed by independently verifiable proof certificates via an extension of the DRAT proof format.

**Authors:** Chia-Yu Chang, Fulvio Gesmundo, Jeroen Zuiddam

**Abstract:** We determine the border subrank of higher order structure tensors of several families of algebras, and in particular obtain the following results. (1) We determine tight bounds on the border subrank of $k$-fold matrix multiplication and $k$-fold upper triangular matrix multiplication for all $k$. (2) We determine the border subrank of the higher order structure tensors of truncated polynomial algebras, null algebras, and apolar algebras of a quadric. (3) We determine the border subrank of the higher order structure tensors of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ for all orders. (4) We prove that degeneration of structure tensors of algebras propagates from higher to lower order. Along the way, we investigate which upper bound methods (geometric rank, $G$-stable rank, socle degree) are effective in which settings, and how they relate. Our work extends the results of Strassen (J.~Reine Angew.~Math., 1987, 1991), who determined the asymptotic subrank of these algebras for tensors of order three, in two directions: we determine the border subrank itself rather than its asymptotic version, and we consider higher order structure tensors.

**Authors:** Saptarshi G. Dastider, K. Prashant, P. Shruti, C. Sudheesh, Jobin Cyriac

**Abstract:** Accurate modeling of ion-molecule reaction networks is essential for understanding the chemical evolution of planetary ionospheres, particularly for giant planets where proton-transfer chains drive atmospheric composition. However, predicting reaction rates in these ultracold environments remains a challenge due to the non-trivial interplay between vibrational dynamics and quantum tunneling. In this work we present a chaos-diagnostic framework that integrates multireference electronic structure theory, Adiabatic Gauge Potentials (AGP), and Random Matrix Theory (RMT) to characterize the microscopic dynamics of proton transport. Using the formation of H+3 and the proton-bound cluster H+5 as representative model systems relevant to Jovian atmospheres, we demonstrate that the transition state acts as a dynamical bottleneck where quantum chaos is notably suppressed, effectively enhancing tunneling probabilities. We introduce a fragility index based on the AGP slope to quantify how specific vibrational modes reintroduce chaos and suppress reactivity. This diagnostic approach offers a generalizable, data-driven metric for identifying vibrationally gated pathways in complex astrochemical networks, providing a theoretical basis for refining kinetic models of planetary and interstellar plasmas

**Abstract:** Many tools and techniques measure local structure in materials in contexts ranging from biology to geology. We survey the tools and metrics that are especially useful for analyzing particulate soft matter. The metrics we discuss can all be computed from the positions of the particles, and are thus most useful when there is access to this information, either from simulation or experimental imaging. For each metric, we provide derivations, intuition regarding its implications, example uses, and references to software packages that compute the metric. Our survey encompasses characterization techniques ranging from the simplest to the most complex, and will be useful for readers getting started in the structural characterization of particle systems.

**Authors:** Aaron T. Bondy, Klaus Bartschat

**Abstract:** We present ab initio calculations using the $R$-matrix with time dependence (RMT) method for high-order harmonic generation (HHG) in argon in a short, intense pulse regime. The calculations employ a $6$-cycle $\sin^2$ pulse at $850$ nm with peak intensity $2.3\times 10^{14}$ W/cm$^2$ and, for comparison with the experiment by Guo et al. [J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 51, 034006 (2018)], a Gaussian pulse with the same frequency and peak intensity. Both pulse shapes yield the expected harmonic structure in the region above the ionization threshold (approximately $15.82$ eV in $LS$-coupling). The spectra exhibit strong carrier-envelope-phase (CEP) sensitivity. The energy region leading up to the ionization threshold contains spectral features arising from residual coherent dipole oscillations (free-induction decay) that strongly depend on spectral windowing and the post-pulse propagation time. We show that the HHG spectrum, particularly below the ionization threshold, is a defined quantity that depends on analysis choices rather than being a uniquely determined observable. Comparison between theoretical predictions and experimental observations in this energy regime, therefore, requires explicit specification of these parameters.

**Authors:** Rebeka Sarkar, Krishna Kumar, Sugata Pratik Khastgir

**Abstract:** The linear and nonlinear motions of a damped rigid planar pendulum, driven by vibrating its pivot sinusoidally, are reexamined. The pendulum is known to exhibit periodic, quasiperiodic, and chaotic motions. Floquet analysis identifies regions of instability and stability within the driving parameter space. A new type of nonlinear oscillation may occur at driving parameters where Floquet analysis predicts a stable stationary state. Such non-Floquet oscillations always have periods longer than twice the period of the vibrating pivot. The possible periods of these oscillations may be four, six, eight, or twelve times the driving period. The power spectrum of the pendulum's angular velocity during these oscillations reveals a novel feature: the two dominant response frequencies sum to the driving frequency.

## 220. Fusion of light nuclei in a multicluster realization of the three-body problem
**Source:** arXiv | **Date:** 2026-04-24 | **Relevance Score:** -0.008
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** Mikhail Egorov

**Abstract:** This work describes a few-body dynamics method based on the Faddeev integral equations in momentum space for determining the total cross sections of fusion and breakup reactions with two- and three-body final channels in the continuum, employing a cluster representation of the colliding nuclei. Total cross sections were obtained for the reactions $^3\text{He}(T,D)^4\text{He}$, $^3\text{He}(T,np)^4\text{He}$, $^3\text{He}(T,nD)^3\text{He}$, $^3\text{He}(^3\text{He},2p)^4\text{He}$, $^3\text{He}(^3\text{He},pD)^3\text{He}$, $^7\text{Li}(^3\text{He},\phantom{0}^4\text{He})^6\text{Li}$, $^7\text{Li}(^3\text{He},D^4\text{He})^4\text{He}$, and $^7\text{Li}(^3\text{He},T^3\text{He})^4\text{He}$, in which both the projectile and the target nucleus were treated in a cluster representation. The work also implements a two-potential method to determine the Coulomb $t-$matrix and to account for Coulomb effects in short-range dynamics in momentum space. Calculations of the initial-state Coulomb interaction were performed; furthermore, an estimate was obtained for the magnitude of the off-shell effect of the Coulomb $t-$matrix, as well as the magnitude of the atomic electron anti-screening effect on the Coulomb interaction of the colliding nuclei. The calculated contribution of the cluster mechanism to the total cross section of the considered fusion reactions in the kinetic energy range $T\in[1~\text{keV},20~\text{MeV}]$ is in good agreement with known experimental data.

**Abstract:** Surface oxides contribute to losses in superconducting transmon devices resulting in degraded performance. We explore the use of the damascene process to replace the sidewall native oxide of a device with a metal/substrate interface. We simulate sidewall oxidation by burying an oxide layer during fabrication. We observe a modest improvement between the two types of devices, which is suggestive of a reduction in the surface participation ratio.

## 222. A note on the kinematic boundary condition with historical perspective
**Source:** American Journal of Physics | **Date:** 2026-04-27 | **Relevance Score:** -0.031
**Tags:** Technical / Pure Physics

**Authors:** G. R. Hunt, J. P. Webb

**Abstract:** The kinematic boundary condition results from the application of conservation of mass at the bounding surface of a fluid. For a material interface, this condition reduces to the requirement that there is no flux of fluid across the boundary. As demonstrated, this can be satisfied by fluid particles which remain on the interface. However, following Kelvin, it is highlighted that this commonly referenced scenario is a special case of a more general result. The mathematical expression of the kinematic boundary condition is more complex when there is a transfer of mass across the interface. Conservation of mass is still applicable across interfaces of this type, and the resulting condition is shown to collapse to that for a material surface when the mass flux across the interface is zero.
